<h2 class="nobreak">PROLOGUE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">OF all the fairy countries in the
world none is more wonderful or
beautiful than the country where the
Fire Fairies live. Into that land no
fairies of the earth, or air, or water dare
venture. They would be seared, or
changed to ash or vapor.</p>

<p>Many are the doors that open into
the Fire Kingdom&mdash;thousands, and
hundreds of thousands in number.
Wherever you see the firelight flicker,
wherever you see flames leaping and
dancing, wherever you hear the snap of
the burning logs, there you may be sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
is an open door. Then if you choose
to creep close to it, and peer in, you may
perhaps see wonderful things; fairy
forms that flit and vanish, and reappear,
and vanish again among the leaping
flames, and smoldering embers. Perhaps,
also, you may see the shining
domes and glittering turrets of the fairy
palaces.</p>

<p>But when the fire burns down, and
the hearth grows dark the door is closed&mdash;there
is no more to be seen of that
wonderland.</p>

<p>In the very heart of the Fire Country
stands the palace of King Red Flame,
the gleaming flame-colored palace, the
Palace of Burning Coals. Round it lies
a wonderful garden, where paths wind
away among great fields of fire lilies,
and flame roses lift their heads, and the
tall shining trees rustle in the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
with a sound like the whispering of the
fire on the hearth. Here in this glowing
country the good and happy fairies
work and play, and serve their king as
all good fairies should.</p>

<p>But not all fairies in this land are
good and happy. Beyond the glow of
the roses and the lilies, beyond all sight
of the glimmering trees, there lies another
part of the country where live the
evil fairies of that land. Here are great
Plains of Ash, and huge Caverns of
Soot, and stretches of gloom where
comes and goes the Shadow Witch.
Here Imps of Darkness lurk, here
Dragons crouch, and Wizards dwell.
Perhaps sometimes when you have
looked into the Fireplace you have seen
those dismal plains and darksome
valleys. They lie away from the heart
of the Fire, at the side of the Hearth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and between the flames and the heaps
of ashes.</p>

<p>And now listen, and I will tell you of
Prince Radiance, and Princess White
Flame who lived in the Fire Country
and of many strange and wonderful adventures
through which they journeyed
on to reach at last a never-ending
happiness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONCE upon a time a wicked
Earth Fairy went forth to see
what mischief she could do. She flitted
on and on until she came to a House
Door. She had come to one of the
homes where the good and useful
House Fairies dwell. The Door was
open, and she crept up to it slyly, and
peered in. There she saw a great room,
in perfect order, for the House Fairies
had put everything to rights before they
went away to their tasks upstairs. The
floor was swept, the pictures hung trim
and straight upon the walls, the chairs
were dusted and set about invitingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and on the Hearth the Fire burned
warm and clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hhm!&#8221; muttered the Earth Fairy.
&#8220;Here is the very chance I&#8217;ve been looking
for!&#8221;</p>

<p>She slipped inside the Door and set
to work at once. She sprinkled ashes
on the clean-swept floor, and set the
chairs askew. She pulled the pictures
crooked, and turned their faces to the
wall. Into every corner of the room
she went, making mischief, and leaving
disorder behind her. No one came to
interrupt her, so that she kept on and
on with her malicious task until the
room was in complete confusion.
Wearied with the mischief she had done,
she paused and looked about her for a
place to rest. On the Hearth lay a great
bank of warm ashes, soft as a feather-bed.
She went to it at once, and threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
herself down upon it, thinking to rest
only a moment before she journeyed on.
Now this was a very dangerous thing
for an Earth Fairy to do, because none
but Fire Fairies can safely rest so close
to Fire and Flame. But this the Earth
Fairy did not know, so she sank down,
meaning to rest but for a short time, but
she was so weary that before she knew
it she had fallen off into a deep sleep,
and while she slept the Fire stole from
her all her Earth magic, and her Earth
powers.</p>

<p>Since the Fire was burning, that
Door to the Fire Country was of course
wide open, so that King Red Flame riding
out that morning on his flame-colored
horse caught a glimpse of the
Earth Fairy&#8217;s yellow hair as she lay in
the ashes. He drew near to see who
was slumbering there. At the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
glance he knew that she was not a Fire
Fairy. It was plain, too, that she was
not a House Fairy. Whoever she was,
he knew that she was in great danger,
and that she must be rescued at once.</p>

<p>He called to her, but she neither
answered nor stirred. He alighted from
his horse, and bending over her shook
her gently, but she gave no sign of life.
He shook her more roughly, and called
louder, but quite in vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have to take her to the
palace,&#8221; murmured King Red Flame to
himself. &#8220;Here I can do nothing.
Queen Glow and I must consult together
over the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted the Earth Fairy in his arms,
and laid her across his horse. Then
mounting again, he rode away with her
in the direction of the Palace of Burning
Coals, satisfied that there, in counsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
with his queen, he could bring succor to
the stranger in her great need.</p>

<p>Queen Glow was a very beautiful
fairy, and as wise and good as she was
beautiful. Always her thought was
how she could help and comfort those
who were in trouble or distress. As
soon as King Red Flame arrived at the
palace, Queen Glow had the insensible
Earth Fairy carried to her own room,
and laid upon her royal bed. Here she
bent over her, chafing her hands, and
trying in every way to revive her.</p>

<p>There was deep silence in the room,
except for the suppressed whispering
of a little group of Fire Fairies gathered
about the door. One by one other
fairies that belonged to the palace came
to join them, and among the rest came
Grey Smoke, old and wise, she who had
nursed Queen Glow as a child.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>As soon as Grey Smoke saw the Earth
Fairy, she said, &#8220;She has rested too long
on the Hearth. She has rested too long
in the heat. Never again can she return
to her own life. There is only one
thing left for us to do. We must change
her into a Fire Fairy. In this way only
can she again be wakened into life.
Then she can live happily among us,
and fill her uses in the Fire Kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is so great a change as that to
be wrought?&#8221; asked King Red Flame.
&#8220;Have you knowledge of such a spell
as will accomplish this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dame Grey Smoke shook her head.
&#8220;No, Your Majesty, not I,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;But there is in the palace, greater
knowledge than I possess. It was written
long ago in the Book of Spells, that
lies locked away in your treasury.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; cried the King. &#8220;Why had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
I not thought of that? Let the book be
brought!&#8221;</p>

<p>The King and Queen waited in
silence while a trusted messenger was
dispatched to fetch it from the treasure
chamber where it lay. When it was
brought the King drew from his bosom
a tiny key, which hung about his neck
from a golden thread. As the King unlocked
the book, a thin mist of magic
floated out from its pages, and circled
about his head for a moment before it
disappeared. A thrill of awe passed
through the watching fairies.</p>

<p>Slowly the King turned page after
page, until at last he paused. &#8220;It is
here,&#8221; said he. He and the Queen
stooped above the book, reading the
strange and crabbed letters written so
many ages ago by the masters of fairy
magic. When they had read the charm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
through to the end, the King lifted his
head: &#8220;None but those who work this
charm may see it wrought,&#8221; commanded
he. Then one by one the fairies
passed from the royal bedchamber, leaving
the King and Queen alone.</p>

<p>All was silent in the room. The
charm had been spoken&mdash;the spell had
been wrought. The King and Queen
stood watching the still motionless form
of the Earth Fairy.</p>

<p>At last through her passed a thrill of
wakening life. She turned upon her
side. Her eyelids fluttered, then opened
wide, and her eyes rested in bewilderment
upon the two bending over her.
From them her eyes wandered to the
room about her. She raised herself
upon her elbow. &#8220;Where am I?&#8221; she
demanded in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in the Kingdom of the Fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Fairies,&#8221; answered Queen Glow gently.
&#8220;But do not be afraid. You are safe
here, for we have changed you into a
Fire Fairy, and there is now no more
danger for you here from heat or flame
than there is for our own royal selves.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy&#8217;s face grew black
with anger. &#8220;A Fire Fairy!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;I, a Fire Fairy! That must never be.
I am of the Earth. How dared you
meddle with an Earth Fairy? Let me
go instantly. I am going back to my
own country&mdash;to my own kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That cannot be,&#8221; answered the
King. &#8220;There is no spell to transform
you to what you were, and it was only by
changing you into a Fire Fairy that we
were able to awaken you from sleep. If
we had not done this, you would have
slept and slept yourself away into a film
of ashes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Carefully then he explained to her
where he had found her, and how every
means had been tried to rouse her, but
in vain, and only by the power of the
Book of Spells had it been possible to
save her. But nothing that the King or
Queen could say&mdash;no words, however
kind or wise, made the slightest difference
to the Earth Fairy. She sprang
from the bed, and stamped her foot.
She wept, she stormed.</p>

<p>By and by, however, she became
sulky, and sank into silence, and would
not even answer what the King and
Queen said to her. They were obliged
to leave her alone, and though she ate
the food that was presently sent to her,
she would neither speak, nor look at the
attendants who brought it.</p>

<p>But as time passed the Earth Fairy
grew less sullen, and even seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in some measure content with her new
home, and her life in the palace, but
Queen Glow felt sorry for her, and kept
her near as her own personal attendant.
If any difference was made by the
Queen between her and the Fire Fairies,
it was that she treated her with especial
kindness and affection. But the new
lady in waiting never forgot her old
life, and although she was now a Fire
Fairy, she always insisted upon being
called Earth Fairy, and that was the
name by which everyone knew her.</p>

<p>At last there came a time when she
really seemed to respond to kindness,
and to feel a certain love for the Queen.
She sought to please her, and was
always cheerful and complacent, and on
their part the King and Queen trusted
her more and more. There was nothing
in the palace that they would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
have given her, nor anything that they
would not have granted to her, if she had
asked; that is, nothing that was at all
possible.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact, all this affection
and pleasantness was only seeming.
The Earth Fairy hated both
the King and Queen, and longed to
be revenged upon them for the
change they had wrought in her, even
though it had been done to save
her. Constantly her anger burned
against them, and she only awaited a
chance to wreak vengeance upon them.
The Earth Fairy was crafty, and had the
patience of craft. She was willing to
wait and watch a long while if necessary,
if only her chance would come in
the end.</p>

<p>While waiting she watched and
listened, learning such spells as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
could from the fairies around her, and
practicing them in secret. There was
not a book of magic in the Palace of
Burning Coals that she did not seek out
and pore over; not a wand that she did
not try. Only the King&#8217;s own Book
of Spells was locked away from her, and
one precious wand that had belonged to
the mother of King Red Flame, and had
been left by her in charge of the Fairy
Grey Smoke, oldest and wisest of any
save one in the Kingdom of the Fire
Fairies. No one else, not even the King
himself knew of this wand, for his
mother had made Grey Smoke promise
that she would never tell him of it, nor
bring it from its secret hiding-place
until some great need arose that called
for a spell that nothing could possibly
break.</p>

<p>If the Earth Fairy had known of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
wand she would have spared no pains
to get hold of it; but Grey Smoke was
wise and faithful, and kept the trust that
the King&#8217;s mother had reposed in her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was a shining morning in Spring.
King Red Flame put on his scarlet
cloak and cap, kissed Queen Glow
good-by, mounted his flame-colored
horse, and rode away in the direction of
the Dying Embers where he had been
called upon important business.</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy, peeping from an
upper window of the Palace of Burning
Coals, watched him out of sight. Then
she clapped her hands gleefully.
&#8220;When you come back, King Red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Flame&mdash;ah, yes&mdash;when you come back,
I think perhaps you will find a surprise
awaiting you.&#8221; For at last the Earth
Fairy saw a chance for the revenge for
which she had long been watching, and
if things but fell out as she hoped, there
was no wand nor spell that could restore
to the King the priceless treasure
that she purposed to destroy.</p>

<p>That night all was still and tranquil
in the Palace of Burning Coals, but the
next morning a sudden stir arose.
Sooner than the Queen had been led to
expect it a very wonderful thing had
happened in the palace, for very early,
with the dawning, a tiny baby Princess
came to be the daughter of King Red
Flame, and Queen Glow.</p>

<p>All was tumult and rejoicing. The
Queen lay proud and happy on the satin
pillows of her great golden bed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
looked and looked at the beautiful little
Princess in the golden cradle at her side.
Everyone was delighted at the coming
of this Princess, but none seemed more
so than the Earth Fairy herself. She
stayed close by the Queen&#8217;s side, ready
to anticipate her every want, and joined
with the rest in her admiration of the
baby Princess.</p>

<p>As soon as the child arrived, a messenger
was sent in haste to recall King
Red Flame to the palace, but before the
man rode forth the Earth Fairy
hastened down, and even as he was placing
his foot in the stirrup, she told him
that Queen Glow had decided not to
send word to the King, as his business
was too important to be interrupted.
Instead the messenger was to ride off in
exactly the opposite direction, and fetch
back a golden cup which Queen Glow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
had ordered to be ready when she should
send for it.</p>

<p>This was a false errand, but the Earth
Fairy did not wish anyone to know that
she had countermanded the Queen&#8217;s
order, and if he were seen to set out on
a journey, all would suppose that he had
gone in search of the King.</p>

<p>Soon after the messenger had departed,
the Queen said to the Earth
Fairy, who was sitting beside her, &#8220;Send
everybody away except yourself. I wish
to rest. You yourself are so quiet, dear
Earth Fairy, you will not disturb me,
and you can watch over my little
daughter, and see that no harm comes
to her while I sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be only too happy, Your
Highness, to do anything that pleases
you,&#8221; answered the Earth Fairy sweetly.</p>

<p>So it was that the Queen, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Earth Fairy, and the baby Princess were
presently left alone together, and as
Queen Glow turned on her side and
closed her eyes, the Earth Fairy seated
herself beside the cradle with a piece of
embroidery.</p>

<p>Before Queen Glow fell asleep, she
murmured softly, &#8220;To-morrow, Earth
Fairy, King Red Flame will be here.
Only think how happy he will be to see
his little daughter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Your Highness; what happiness!&#8221;
purred the Earth Fairy from her
chair beside the cradle.</p>

<p>Now the room grew very still, and
Queen Glow fell into a profound
slumber. Then the Earth Fairy laid
down her embroidery, and rose softly
from her chair. She tiptoed to the bed,
bent over the Queen, and listened intently
to her breathing, till she was certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
that her mistress slept. Then she
crept from the room, and was gone for
some little time. When she returned,
she brought, concealed in the folds of
her dress, a bundle of the most powerful
wands that the palace contained.
She stood a moment and listened. The
Queen and the Princess slept as before.</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy locked the door
quickly, and made haste to open the
bundle of wands. She took out the one
that she knew to be the most potent, and
carried it to the bedside of the Queen.
It was serpent-shaped and slender, and
as the Earth Fairy waved it above the
Queen long green tongues of flame
darted from its tip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep,&#8221; whispered the Earth Fairy.
&#8220;Sleep till I bid you waken.&#8221; At these
words the Queen sank into an even
deeper slumber than before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Then the Earth Fairy turned to the
defenseless Princess. With one sweep
of the glimmering wand, she bound the
cradle within a magic circle, so that she
might weave a spell that no power could
break.</p>

<p>But at the very moment that the first
word of her charm fell from her lips
there came a sudden knock at the door.
The Earth Fairy was startled. She
thrust the wand behind her, stole swiftly
to the door, and laid her ear to the keyhole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; she demanded in a
low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I&mdash;Grey Smoke,&#8221; was the
answer. &#8220;I bear a message to the
Queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Queen Glow has given orders that
she is not to be disturbed,&#8221; returned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Earth Fairy. &#8220;She sleeps, and I can
awaken her for no one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Satisfied with the answer that she had
received, Grey Smoke took her departure,
and the wicked Earth Fairy returned
to the cradle of the Princess.
She had no more than drawn a second
time her circle of enchantment, had but
once waved her wand above the little
Princess, than there came another, and
a louder knock.</p>

<p>Furious that her spell should again
be interrupted, the Earth Fairy threw
down her wand, and hurried to the door.
&#8220;Who is it now who comes to disturb
the Queen?&#8221; she demanded sharply.
&#8220;Has not everyone been told that her
Majesty wishes to sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I&mdash;Spark&mdash;the page,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;My business is important. A
golden necklace has just arrived for Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Highness the Princess, with orders to
deliver it to the Queen at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her Majesty is not to be disturbed
for any purpose,&#8221; retorted the Earth
Fairy. &#8220;Go away at once, and put it in
a place of safety till she awakens.&#8221;</p>

<p>The page was not satisfied. &#8220;Since
the Queen cannot be disturbed,&#8221; replied
he, &#8220;you must yourself take it, and keep
it until she awakens. Open the door,
and I will give it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obliged to control her anger, lest
Spark should become suspicious that
mischief was on foot, the Earth Fairy
opened the door the merest crack, and
received a marvelous golden box from
his hands. At any other time she certainly
would have turned it over curiously,
and if no one had been by she
would have peeped within, but now she
was only anxious to guard the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to the room as well as she could, and to
shut the door quickly, before the sharp
eyes of Spark should see too much.</p>

<p>Careful as she was, however, she did
not succeed in preventing him from
catching a glimpse of the bundle of
wands lying upon the Queen&#8217;s bed. The
sight of them in this unexpected place
excited his suspicions at once, but he
was far too clever to say anything concerning
them to the Earth Fairy. She
would give him no satisfaction, he was
sure. But he lost no time in going to
Grey Smoke, who was his grandmother,
and telling her what he had seen.</p>

<p>Grey Smoke looked very grave. She
had never trusted Earth Fairy, and now
a strange fear took possession of her.
&#8220;I will go to the Queen at once,&#8221; declared
she. &#8220;I&mdash;her old nurse, must see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to it that no harm comes to her in the
King&#8217;s absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>But swiftly as Grey Smoke hastened
to the side of her mistress, she was too
late, for as soon as the page had departed,
the Earth Fairy snatched up her
wand and rushed to the cradle of the
Princess. Quickly she drew once more
her magic circle. Quickly she waved
the flaming wand three times above the
sleeping child. &#8220;Become invisible!&#8221;
she hissed&mdash;&#8220;Become invisible!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the little Princess vanished
from before her eyes, leaving only the
golden cradle standing empty beside the
Queen&#8217;s bed.</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy was filled with delight
when she saw that she had accomplished
what she had set out to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I will awaken Queen Glow,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
said she triumphantly. &#8220;She shall see
that she is not the only one who can
work spells.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though the form of the Princess had
indeed vanished from the cradle, the
Earth Fairy did not notice that a tender
white flame was hovering above the
place where the child had lain, for there
was one thing that the wicked fairy,
with all her knowledge of magic did not
know: that is, that no Fire Fairy can
ever be made entirely invisible. Though
its form may vanish, its spirit is always
seen as a fine flame.</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy, in her impatience
to show the hapless Queen how she
had revenged herself, had turned her
back upon the cradle as soon as her spell
was fully wrought, and was not aware
of the presence of the tiny flame. She
took up the wand with which to arouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the Queen. She leaned over her, and
touched her with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awake!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>Immediately, as if she had only waited
for the word, the Queen opened her
eyes, and saw with astonishment and
amaze the evil triumph written upon the
face of the Earth Fairy. Instantly she
started from her pillows, and glanced in
the direction of the cradle. She saw
that it was empty, and saw the tiny
white flame flickering where the little
Princess had been. Then her eyes fell
upon the bundle of wands, and she
knew what had been done to her helpless
child.</p>

<p>She gave a great cry that rang
through the room. Grey Smoke, hurrying
down the palace hall, heard it and
hastened still faster. Without waiting
to knock, without even trying the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
she wound herself like a thin gray
thread through the keyhole, was on the
other side of the door in a moment, and
stood beside her mistress in her own
shape.</p>

<p>The Queen lay back among her satin
pillows, quite without life. Grief at
that what had happened to her beloved
child had broken her heart.</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy and her wands were
nowhere to be seen, for as soon as the
Queen had cried out, she had made haste
to escape by another door that led to a
distant part of the palace.</p>

<p>Grey Smoke was filled with horror at
what she saw. At first she was unable
to move, or even to think. But she recovered
herself quickly. Something
must be done. She rushed to the door,
tore it open, and called aloud for help.</p>

<p>Spark, who was lingering in the hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
came at once, eager to learn what she
had discovered, but his grandmother&#8217;s
face showed him that it was no time for
questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go quickly, Spark,&#8221; commanded
she. &#8220;Bring every fairy in the palace.
Something terrible has happened.
Bring everyone, but especially the Earth
Fairy; on no account must she be
allowed to escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away flashed Spark in hot haste, and
did his errand so well, that presently the
bedroom of the Queen was filled with
anxious fairies. Under the direction of
old Grey Smoke, everything known to
fairy lore was done to revive Queen
Glow, but nothing was of the least avail.
Knowing but too well, by the flame
hovering above the cradle, what had
happened to the Princess, a band of the
most trustworthy and faithful fairies set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
themselves as a guard about her, lest the
one who had done this wicked deed
might seek to approach and do further
harm, if that were possible.</p>

<p>It was not until all the other fairies
were gathered in the room that the Earth
Fairy appeared, with Spark close at her
side, guarding her lest she should try
to escape. But the Earth Fairy made
no attempt to do this. When she
entered the room she seemed to be overwhelmed
by surprise at what she saw,
and to be the most grief-stricken of
them all.</p>

<p>Grey Smoke pointed an accusing
finger at her. &#8220;Wicked one,&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;It is you who have done this to our
Queen, and to our little Princess. It is
you who must pay the penalty when
King Red Flame returns, and finds
what you have done.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>The Earth Fairy interrupted her indignantly,
and declared with a storm of
sobs and tears that she was absolutely innocent,
and that when she had left the
room to put away the wands the Queen
had asked her to bring, that all had been
well; the Queen had been sleeping
quietly in her bed, and the child had
been in the cradle by her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say no more,&#8221; commanded Grey
Smoke. &#8220;No one believes you for a
moment. No one else would have
wrought evil upon our dear Queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of everything that the Earth
Fairy said to try to prove her innocence,
she was taken away under a close guard
of Fire Fairies, to be given over to the
keepers of the prison.</p>

<p>Around the cradle of the baby
Princess a ceaseless watch was kept.
The Fire Fairies who were appointed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
guard it kept their eyes fixed upon the
white and flickering flame, awaiting the
return of King Red Flame.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NOW all this time King Red Flame
knew nothing of the happiness
and the misfortune that had come to his
queen. He finished the business that
had taken him forth as quickly as he
could, and then, in haste, he turned his
horse toward home. But it was by another
road that he returned to the palace,
and it was for this reason that he missed
the messengers that Grey Smoke had
sent to seek him.</p>

<p>Three days had passed since he had
bade farewell to the Queen, and now he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
was soon to see her again. Light-heartedly
he rode along, singing a
snatch of a song that the Queen loved,
and more than once he took from his
pouch a beautiful flashing necklace that
he was bringing as a present to his wife.
As he held it up in the glowing light it
shone and flashed as only magic can.
He smiled with delight as he thought
of the pleasure it would give her.</p>

<p>So full of joy was he that when he
reached the palace gate he failed to
notice the sad faces and tear-stained
eyes of the fairies that came out to meet
him, and take his horse. Only as he
hurried up the palace stairs did he realize
that the place seemed quieter than
usual.</p>

<p>But presently, drawing still nearer to
the chamber of Queen Glow, the sound
of the wailing of many voices smote on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
his ears, and the nearer he drew to her
chamber, the louder it became. Fear
suddenly awoke in his heart, and drove
his feet swiftly forward. He rushed to
the Queen&#8217;s door, flung it wide open, and
stood for a moment looking in. Then
he hurried to her bedside, the fairies
shrinking away before him to right and
left.</p>

<p>There upon the bed lay the Queen, as
fair and white as some beautiful figure
carved in ivory.</p>

<p>With a loud cry King Red Flame
fell on his knees beside the bed, and
clasping the lifeless hand of the Queen
in his, he called to her, beseeching her
to look at him, to wake, to speak. It
seemed indeed as though he were unable
to believe that she could no longer
hear him.</p>

<p>At last, laying down her hand, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
raised himself slowly to his feet. &#8220;Tell
me,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;how has this happened,
and what has brought this terrible misfortune
upon our land?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment all were still. Then
Grey Smoke stepped forth from among
the rest. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it
is the work of the Earth Fairy. It is she
who has revenged herself thus.&#8221; Then
briefly she told him all that had happened
since he had ridden away.</p>

<p>Silently the King listened, too
stunned for word or thought. There
was a pause, and then Grey Smoke laid
a gentle hand upon his sleeve, and spoke
again: &#8220;Your Highness,&#8221; said she respectfully,
&#8220;do not forget that the baby
Princess needs you, and that she who
has wrought all this evil is still free and
unpunished.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that King Red Flame turned his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
head, and looked at the golden cradle.
There above it hovered the tiny white
flame, the only visible form of the fairy
Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! Alas!&#8221; mourned Grey Smoke
at his ear, &#8220;that this should be all that
is left of the loveliest princess that the
Land of the Fire Fairies has ever seen!&#8221;</p>

<p>The King aroused himself. &#8220;It is too
late,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;to bring my dear Queen
back to life, but at least as far as the
Princess is concerned the guilty one
shall repair her mischief. Bring the
Earth Fairy to me, and after she has restored
my daughter, she shall receive
the punishment she has deserved.&#8221;</p>

<p>At once several fairies hastened away
to seek for the Earth Fairy, and soon
returned guarding her in their midst.
She was weeping bitterly. As soon as
her captors released her, she threw herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
at the King&#8217;s feet. &#8220;Alas! Alas!&#8221;
she wailed, &#8220;the Queen is dead, and
they accuse me of being the cause.
Though why, I cannot understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know why they accuse you,&#8221;
answered the King sternly. &#8220;I am but
too well assured that it is you who have
brought this grief upon us all. Now it
is for you to break the spell you have
laid upon the Princess, and after that
we will consider what punishment is
fitting for such a one as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess!&#8221; cried the Earth
Fairy, &#8220;I left her here in the cradle, but
it appears that harm overtook her also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough!&#8221; cried the King. &#8220;Yours
is the spell that has changed the
Princess to a flame. Yours must be the
spell to restore her to her shape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I know nothing of spells,&#8221; exclaimed
the Earth Fairy desperately.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>Grey Smoke started forward vehemently.
&#8220;What then were you doing
with the wands that Spark saw when
you opened the door?&#8221; she demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy flushed deeply, but
answered without hesitation. &#8220;Before
my mistress fell asleep, she bade me bring
her a certain bundle of wands that she
wished to look at. I brought them, as
she bade me, and she looked at them,
taking some in her hands, and putting
others aside. After that she gave them
back to me, and bade me return them.
While I was still busy putting them
away, these Fire Fairies came and
seized me roughly, crying that the
Queen was dead, and that I was to
blame. But listen&mdash;who was it that accused
me? It was Grey Smoke who
forced her way into the chamber of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Queen in my absence&mdash;it is Grey Smoke
who says these things about me. How
do you know that it is not Grey Smoke
herself who has done this deed? What
more likely than, having done it, she
should try to throw the blame upon
another?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not dare to accuse my good Grey
Smoke. There is none whom I trust
more than I do her,&#8221; retorted the King
angrily. &#8220;Had we but chosen her as the
Queen&#8217;s attendant, this grief would not
have come upon us. Nothing that you
can say will ever make me believe that
you are not guilty. But we are wasting
time. You have been brought to break
the spell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stubbornly, again and again, the
Earth Fairy repeated that she knew
nothing of spells, either to make them
or break them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>&#8220;Take her away,&#8221; commanded the
King at last. &#8220;Let her be kept in a
dungeon, away from everyone, until she
consents to restore the Princess to her
true form.&#8221; In spite of the Earth
Fairy&#8217;s cries and struggles she was
dragged away, to be kept securely under
lock and key, until she was ready to obey
the King&#8217;s command.</p>

<p>This done, King Red Flame had a
golden box brought that contained the
very finest wands that he possessed, and
tried with all the skill he knew to break
the spell cast over his daughter; but it
was quite in vain&mdash;the white flame still
fluttered above the cradle, and the baby
Princess still remained invisible. The
King was filled with despair, for
he knew of nothing more that he
could do to break the Earth Fairy&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
spell. Overcome with grief he turned
to leave the room.</p>

<p>And now a strange thing happened.
The tiny white flame, leaving the cradle,
followed after him very timidly, but very
steadily, as if the fairy Princess knew
him, and longed to be close by him, in
the shelter of his love and protection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, look, Your Majesty,&#8221; cried
Grey Smoke, &#8220;the little Princess follows
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The King was touched to the heart.
He commanded that the Princess&#8217;s
cradle should be brought to his own
chamber, and there sitting beside it, he
rested his head sadly upon his hand, and
pondered deeply, while still the white
flame hovered quivering and flashing
softly above the cradle.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a low knock at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the door, and Grey Smoke&#8217;s voice was
heard, asking if she might enter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, Grey Smoke,&#8221; replied the
King, and as the door opened, and the
old nurse came in, he added, &#8220;Let us see
whether you cannot suggest some way
to help my poor little daughter. For
me&mdash;I have no thought left.&#8221; He
sighed heavily as he spoke, and from
the white flame above the cradle there
seemed to float a faint answering sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Majesty, do not despair,&#8221;
counseled Grey Smoke. &#8220;It is true that
the spell cast upon the Princess is a
powerful one, but I am sure that in time
everything will turn out well. I have
been to see the Wise One, and he has
told me that only the Veil of Disenchantment
that lies hidden in his
magic chest can break the spell that rests
upon the Princess.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>The King sprang to his feet eagerly.
&#8220;There is, then, some magic thing that
can break this enchantment?&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Let us go at once and fetch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is impossible,&#8221; replied Grey
Smoke. &#8220;Only the prince who will one
day come&mdash;he who is fated to win the
Princess as his bride, can see this Veil.
Only in his hands is it potent to restore
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>King Red Flame shook his head in
doubt. &#8220;My good nurse,&#8221; he groaned,
&#8220;what hope can there be that such a
prince would ever love my poor daughter,
who is nothing but a quivering
flame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no charm that you can bestow
upon her, so that even though she
remains a flame it will win his heart,
and make him long to set her free?&#8221;
inquired Grey Smoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>Again the King sank into deep
thought, and as he sat there silently the
soft cry of the flame again sounded in
his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her voice!&#8221; cried the King.
&#8220;Though her form has been taken from
her, her voice still remains! Could I
but make it the most beautiful voice in
the world, it might draw all hearts to
her, even though she should indeed
remain forever invisible. Had I but a
wand that had not already failed&mdash;but,
as you know, I have already tried with
every wand in the palace to restore the
Princess to her true form, and as you
also know, no wand that has once failed
can be used the second time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Majesty, the time has now
come for me to tell you something that
up to now has been known to no living
soul except myself. When your mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
died, she left in my care a wand more
powerful than any other in the palace.
This wand I was to keep until such
desperate need arose as could be met
by no other magic known to any of us.
It is called the Wand of Good Enchantment.
The time for you to use it has
now come.&#8221; So saying Dame Grey
Smoke drew from under her long cloak
a faded silken case, and laid it in his
hands.</p>

<p>Eagerly the King opened the case,
and drew from it a slender wand,
decked with snow-white feathers. The
moment he touched it, the thrill that
passed through his fingers told him that
it was full of magic. His eyes gleamed
with joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Grey Smoke,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;might
it not be possible that this wand has the
power that none of the others possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to break the spell, and give me back my
daughter? Shall we not try to restore
her at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, nay, Your Majesty! Do not
venture!&#8221; begged Grey Smoke anxiously.
&#8220;Trust to what the Wise One
has told me. As yet no power can restore
the Princess. Do not destroy the
magic of this wand in a useless attempt.
Rather use it to bestow the gift that
will win the heart of the prince who is
to save her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; agreed the King
sadly. &#8220;The risk is too great. It shall
be as you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taking the Wand of Good Enchantment,
he rose, and stood looking down
into the cradle of the little Princess.
Waving it to and fro above the tiny
flame, he said tenderly, &#8220;My daughter,
by the magic of this wand, I bestow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
upon you a voice of such marvelous
sweetness that all who hear it shall be
drawn to you, and it shall in the end
win for you the love of that prince who
alone can save you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were no sooner uttered
than forth from the flame came a gentle
sound of exquisite music, stirring the
heart.</p>

<p>Hearing it, tears of joy rose to the
eyes of King Red Flame. His mother&#8217;s
wand, left to him for his hour of need,
had not failed him.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">DAY followed day, weeks and years
slipped by, and the tiny dancing
flame that was the spirit of the baby
Princess grew larger and more brilliant
year by year. The Fire Fairies called
her Princess White Flame, and regarded
her with the greatest respect and
love, but pity and sympathy were always
mingled with that respect.</p>

<p>The story of the magic Veil was
known, and many princes had heard the
voice of the Princess, and had seen her
passing as a fine white flame. Many
would gladly have won her as a bride;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
many had sought the Wise One&mdash;many
had peered into his ancient chest, but
none had been able to grasp, or even
to see the wondrous Veil that alone
could restore the Princess to her fairy
form.</p>

<p>King Red Flame loved his daughter
dearly, and was never so happy as when
she fluttered gently from place to place
with him, or hovered in the air by his
side when he sat at rest; yet always he
longed to see her face&mdash;to have her visible
presence.</p>

<p>One evening as they were moving
together in the garden, watching the red
and yellow light that came and went
among the fire-lilies that bordered the
winding paths, the King asked her tenderly,
&#8220;My child, have you not yet seen
a prince whom you can love?&#8221;</p>

<p>White Flame laughed softly. &#8220;No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
there is no one. Why do you ask, dear
father?&#8221;</p>

<p>King Red Flame sighed. &#8220;Because
it is only a prince who loves you, and
whom you can love in return, who can
free you from the spell.&#8221;</p>

<p>White Flame stole closer to her
father&#8217;s side, and whispered in his ear,
&#8220;I have not yet seen anyone, dear father,
for whom I would wish to be more than
the glancing flame that they see me
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the King sighed. &#8220;Ah, well,
my daughter, the time may come. But
remember that until it does, your face
is hidden from me also.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NOT far from the Land of the Fire
Fairies there is another wonderland.
It is called the Kingdom of
Light. Here, though the people are
fairies, their magic is different from the
magic of the fairies of fire and flame.
But it is not less marvelous and
beautiful.</p>

<p>The ruler of this country had a son
whose name was Prince Radiance.
The Prince was tall and strong and
handsome. His soft red suit of velvet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
his scarlet cap with long red feather
that tossed and floated above his yellow
hair became him well. So very bright
with hope and courage were his eyes, so
very friendly was his smile, that wherever
he appeared the fairies cried to one
another, &#8220;Ah, here comes Prince Radiance,
bringing happiness and cheer!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young Prince was now of an age
to seek a bride, but the King was too
fond of his son to wish him to marry
anyone whom he did not love with all
his heart. Many princesses and beautiful
ladies would have been glad to be
chosen by him, but the young Prince
cared for none of them. And although
the wise men of the country came often
to their King to urge the Prince to take
a wife, the old King always replied,
&#8220;Not yet, not yet. My son must make
his own choice, and in his own way.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>So time passed, until one day Prince
Radiance asked his father&#8217;s permission
to visit the Land of the Fire Fairies. He
had heard of their strange magic, and
wished to behold it with his own eyes.</p>

<p>The King gave him leave, and bidding
his father farewell, the Prince set
out, quite alone, as was his wish.</p>

<p>By traveling swiftly, he soon reached
the boundary of his father&#8217;s kingdom,
and crossed into the Land of the Fire
Fairies. Now the Fire Fairies have
always been friendly to the Fairies of
Light, so the Prince was made welcome
wherever he went.</p>

<p>The magic of the Fire Fairies charmed
and delighted him. He stood and
watched them rear their shining
palaces, saw them deck the walls with
glittering jewels, or wreathe them with
flaming vines by the mere wave of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
wand. He wandered from place to
place, learning many new and wonderful
things.</p>

<p>And all the time he drew nearer and
nearer to the Palace of Burning Coals,
but as yet he had heard nothing, had
seen nothing of the Princess White
Flame.</p>

<p>At last he came to a garden, whose
open gate showed him bright trees rustling
in the breeze and bushes thick-set
with flame-colored blossoms, showed
him paths that wound away into
stretches of still greater loveliness and
bloom. He had come to the garden of
the Princess.</p>

<p>He entered, and stood a moment, to
see if any would come to stop his progress;
but all was still in the garden, and
not a living creature was anywhere in
sight. He chose the path of greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
beauty, but had not gone far upon it
when he became aware of a voice singing
in the distance, a voice that drew
nearer and more near, until the air
around him was filled with its exquisite
music. Entranced, rooted to the spot,
Prince Radiance listened. Never had
he heard so wondrous a voice. It was
as though it drew his very heart from
his breast to follow it.</p>

<p>So spellbound was he, that at first he
thought only of the voice, but presently
he was filled with an ardent desire to
know from whom it came. But even as
he looked eagerly about him for the
singer, the voice began to recede from
him, and to fade away among the tree-tops.
Then it was, that glancing upward,
he saw a pure and pearl-white
flame, and from the flame came the
magic voice that had so stirred his heart.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Awaking from his trance of wonder
and delight, the Prince sought to follow
it; even as he did so the flame was lost
to sight. He pursued it in the direction
in which he had seen it pass, but in vain.</p>

<p>Still the Prince went on in haste, seeking
someone who could tell him where
it might be found. The faint cracking
of boughs struck on his ear, and going
to the place from whence it came, he saw
a Fire Fairy, pruning a glittering shrub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;where shall I
find the flame that was singing yonder,
the flame with the wonderful voice?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fairy paused in his work, and regarded
the Prince curiously. &#8220;Can it
be,&#8221; inquired he slowly, &#8220;that you have
not heard of the Princess White
Flame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw no Princess,&#8221; answered Radiance,
&#8220;but I heard a voice of magical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
beauty that seemed to come from a pure
white flame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; replied the Fire Fairy, &#8220;that is
indeed our dear Princess. A flame she
is, and a flame she must remain, until
that prince comes at last who alone can
set her free.&#8221; Then he told Prince
Radiance the story of the spell that had
been cast upon her in her cradle; told
him of the wondrous Veil that lay hidden
in the Wise One&#8217;s ancient chest;
told him also of the many princes who
had vainly sought to see it, that they
might deliver the Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, too, must go,&#8221; exclaimed Prince
Radiance. &#8220;Who knows but I may be
more fortunate than they. Tell me at
once where this Wise One is to be
found.&#8221;</p>

<p>Filled with the hope that this at last
might be the true prince, the fairy told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
him exactly how to find the Wise One&#8217;s
hut, and the Prince hurried away.</p>

<p>He had not gone far, however, when
what was his joy to hear once more, soft
and faint at first, but clearer and
stronger as he proceeded, that voice that
had so charmed him a little while
before.</p>

<p>Eagerly, scarce daring to breathe, lest
he should startle the Princess, and drive
her from him, the Prince hastened toward
her.</p>

<p>She was poised at the foot of a great
fire-oak, her flame seeming to wax or
wane as the music rose or fell.</p>

<p>So silently the Prince advanced that
he stood beside her before she was
aware.</p>

<p>&#8220;Princess! Princess White Flame!&#8221;
he cried low, &#8220;Here am I, Prince Radiance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
come to serve you. Say that you
are willing that it should be so.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice, the singing
of the Princess ceased suddenly. Flashing
and trembling at the unexpected
appearance of this stranger, she seemed
about to take flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, do not leave me,&#8221; he besought
her. &#8220;Tell me, rather, that I too may
seek to deliver you from the cruel spell
that binds you thus.&#8221;</p>

<p>So did his face glow with the love
that her voice had awakened in his
heart, so did his own voice thrill with
tenderness, that a soft and roseate flush
passed over the whiteness of the flame,
as if in answer. Yet she spoke no word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what I must do,&#8221; pursued the
Prince. &#8220;A fairy has told me. Even
now I was on my way to seek the Wise
One, and happily to bring forth the
mystic Veil. Do you bid me go?&#8221; He
paused, and waited for the Princess to
speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="Here am I, Prince Radiance, come to serve you" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Here am I, Prince Radiance, come to serve you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she whispered softly, &#8220;go.
But ah&mdash;if you should not see this Veil&mdash;what
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;ah then,&#8221; he answered
quickly, &#8220;I will return to you, and gaze
upon your pure and beauteous flame,
and listen to your magic voice, till love
shall make keen the eyes that were too
dull before. Say that you will await me
here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again a rosy flush overspread the
whiteness of the Princess. &#8220;I promise
you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When you return, you
will find me waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Overjoyed at so gracious an answer,
Prince Radiance drew still nearer to
the glowing flame. &#8220;Ah, my beloved
Princess,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;something tells me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that I shall not fail. I shall return indeed,
and in my hand shall be the Veil
that will set you free. Farewell, then,
till I come again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he left her, a gleaming whiteness
at the foot of the great fire-oak, and
went his way as the fairy had directed
him.</p>

<p>It was not long until he arrived at the
house of the Wise One. A queer little
scarlet hut, it was, set in the midst of a
thicket of flaming bushes, with a bright
red path that led straight to the door.
The path was worn and hollowed out
by many feet. From the pointed chimney,
and the quaintly peaked roof, down
all the walls to the very ground, the hut
was covered with magic signs that no
one but the Wise One himself understood.</p>

<p>Boldly the Prince approached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
door, and knocked. A voice bade him
enter. The Prince obeyed, and found
himself in the presence of an old, old
fairy, who was sitting before a table,
poring over a great Book of Wisdom.</p>

<p>It was the Wise One. He wore a
long white beard, that swept down
his scarlet robe almost to his feet. A
curious border of fairy letters ran about
the hem of his robe, and as he rose slowly
to greet his guest, they flashed and
moved as if with life. A wave of magic
flowed from them toward the Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome, Prince Radiance,&#8221; said
the Wise One, &#8220;I know your errand.
Come, let us see if you will be able to
succeed where others have failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that it may be so!&#8221; exclaimed
the Prince, following the Wise One,
who led him to a chest that stood in a
corner of the hut. A very ancient chest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
it was, carved deeply with magic inscriptions
that age had had no power
to dim. Huge hinges held it firm; a
huge lock fastened it.</p>

<p>The Prince looked down upon it
with eager hope. He trembled a little
as the Wise One drew from his breast
a key, and fitted it in the lock. Slowly
the key turned. Slowly the lid rose of
itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look within,&#8221; commanded the Wise
One, &#8220;and tell me what you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>In breathless suspense, Prince Radiance
bent over the chest, hoping&mdash;fearing&mdash;so
much hung upon his power to
behold what lay therein. The light was
dim, and the chest deep. For a moment
he saw no more than what looked like
a film of ash upon the bottom of the
chest, and through his heart went a stab
of pain and disappointment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Then, suddenly, his sight seemed to
clear. &#8220;The Veil! The mystic Veil!&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;There! There it lies! I see
it! Oh, I see!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look again,&#8221; said the Wise One.
&#8220;Do you see nothing more?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Prince Radiance bent above
the chest; again he peered earnestly into
its depths. Dimly discerned beside the
Veil lay a sword in its scabbard, and
close beside it a soft grey pouch.</p>

<p>&#8220;A sword is there, and a curious
pouch,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen what none have seen
before,&#8221; replied the Wise One. &#8220;The
Veil is for the Princess, the Sword and
the Pouch for you. Take them, for the
time will come, before your task is done,
when you will need them all. Take out
the Veil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gently the Prince lifted the magic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Veil from out the chest. As it rose, it
floated out and out, and seemed to fill
the hut, like a mist for fineness, like a
web for strength.</p>

<p>The Wise One went to a cabinet, and
drew from it a tiny golden casket. He
returned to the Prince, and said, &#8220;Place
the Veil inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is that possible?&#8221; inquired
Prince Radiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have but to press the corner of
the Veil, and it will become small
enough to fit into the tiniest box. You
have but to lift it from the box, and
shake it out, and it will become as you
behold it now. Do as I have said, and
you will see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince obeyed, and presently the
Veil lay in the golden casket. The Wise
One handed him a golden key. &#8220;Lock
it, and fasten it securely within your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
robe where none can rob you of it,&#8221; he
told him. &#8220;On its safety all your hopes
depend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gravely Prince Radiance did as the
ancient fairy bade him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lift out the Sword,&#8221; directed the
Wise One, &#8220;and draw it from its scabbard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the Prince obeyed. As he laid
his hand upon the hilt it was as if the
Sword answered to his touch, and leapt
from its scabbard, a flashing flame of
blue, that shed a dazzling light on all
around it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the Sword of Flames,&#8221; the Wise
One told him, &#8220;a powerful weapon&mdash;potent
in your hands alone. It will
serve you well. See that you do not lose
it. See that you do not use it until its
day comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Radiance looked at him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
wonder. &#8220;How shall I know the day?&#8221;
asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the day comes you will need
none to tell you,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;And now take the Pouch&mdash;the third
and last gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince replaced the Sword of
Flames in its sheath, and bound it on.
Then stooping he took out the Pouch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open it,&#8221; said the Wise One.</p>

<p>Prince Radiance did so, and saw that
it was divided within into two compartments.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a magic pouch,&#8221; the Wise
One instructed him. &#8220;Whatever you
place in it will never fail of its supply.
It will help you out of many a danger,
out of many a difficulty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince thought deeply. &#8220;What
shall I place within it that will have
such power?&#8221; he asked at last.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>The Wise One smiled. &#8220;That is easy
enough to choose,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;In
the one side place a burning coal; put
in the other a handful of ash. Nothing
else could possibly be so unfailingly
useful wherever you may go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surprised at such an answer, Prince
Radiance gazed at him without obeying.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is as I have told you,&#8221; the ancient
one assured him. &#8220;You will find it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Prince stooped to the fire
that was burning on the hearth, and
filled the Pouch as he had been directed,
and fastened it to his side, the Wise One
watching him meanwhile with a kindly
smile.</p>

<p>When Prince Radiance would have
thanked him for the fairy gifts, he dismissed
him with a wave of the hand.
&#8220;Go,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and all good fortune attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
you. If you but do your part, the
magic of the Veil will be potent to
break the Earth Fairy&#8217;s spell, and restore
the Princess White Flame to her
fairy form.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">FAR from the kingdom of King
Red Flame, in the dismal country
that lies along the Chimney Back
are many dark and mischievous fairies,
and the most mischievous of them all
was Flying Soot.</p>

<p>He was a great traveler, and employed
himself in flitting from place to
place collecting news, and telling it
again wherever he thought that it would
do the most harm. Most of his time was
spent in the Land of Evil Fairies where
he had many friends who gave him welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
for the sake of what he had to tell.
But now and again he crossed secretly
into King Red Flame&#8217;s dominions, in
the hope that he might pick up some information
that he could use. He always
took great care, however, not to allow
himself to be seen by any of the Fire
Fairies.</p>

<p>Upon one of these excursions he overheard
some Fire Fairies repeating the
story of the enchantment of Princess
White Flame, and learned at the same
time about the Earth Fairy&#8217;s imprisonment.
After that he could not rest until
he had found the way to the place where
she was confined.</p>

<p>During all the years that the Earth
Fairy had been locked in her prison,
she had known nothing of what went
on outside of it. She neither knew of
the wondrous Veil in the Wise One&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
ancient chest, nor that it was expected
that a Prince would some day come who
would set the Princess free.</p>

<p>Because of her long imprisonment
her hatred of King Red Flame burned
all the more intensely, but deprived as
she now was of every means of working
magic, she could neither escape, nor
wreak further vengeance upon her
master.</p>

<p>One day, as she sat in a corner of
her cell nursing her anger, she heard
her fairy keeper come to her door and
try it carefully to see that it was still
securely fastened. Then his footsteps
retreated, and she knew that he had
gone away with his companions for a
short rest under the trees as was his daily
custom.</p>

<p>Hardly had the sound of his footsteps
faded away when a faint rustle outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the door caught her ear, and a voice that
was unknown to her softly called her
name.</p>

<p>Making no noise she crept to the keyhole
and peered through. A figure
stood near it, wrapped in a long black
mantle, with a black velvet cap pulled
low over his forehead. From his face
she knew that he was an evil fairy, but
he was a stranger, and fearing that he
might be an enemy she made no answer.</p>

<p>Her visitor was not discouraged. He
called to her again, and told her that he
was Flying Soot. Finding that she still
made no reply, he assured her that he
was a friend, and began at once to give
her what news he could of King Red
Flame and the Princess. At that the
Earth Fairy answered him willingly,
and harkened with eagerness to what he
had to say. They talked for some time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
but as soon as the keeper was heard
returning, Flying Soot scurried off.
After that he came from time to time
to see her and bring the news, and the
knowledge that the Princess was still
but a flame, always filled the Earth
Fairy with wicked satisfaction.</p>

<p>On the day that Prince Radiance
found and talked with Princess White
Flame in the palace garden, Flying
Soot passed near them on his way to the
Earth Fairy&#8217;s prison.</p>

<p>Hearing their voices he drew near
stealthily, and listened to them. As soon
as Prince Radiance departed, away
rushed the mischief-maker to the Earth
Fairy. It was the hour when the keeper
was absent, so that he flew straight to
the door without pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Earth Fairy! Earth Fairy!&#8221; he
called, placing his lips to the keyhole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
&#8220;Come close and listen; I have great
news!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy sprang to the door
at once. &#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded she,
&#8220;Tell me quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Prince has come,&#8221; he told her.
&#8220;A Prince who swears to break the
power of your spell.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the Earth Fairy&#8217;s lips burst a
laugh of scorn. &#8220;Let him try as he
may,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;he will never succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be not too sure of that,&#8221; warned
Flying Soot. &#8220;This Prince spoke with
the Princess of a magic Veil, which he
has but to cast over her to restore her
at once to her true form.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the Earth Fairy was
quite speechless with astonishment and
dismay; then she cried aloud, &#8220;A Veil!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
A magic Veil that will set the Princess
free!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied her companion,
&#8220;Already the Prince has gone to fetch
it from where it lies hidden in the chest
of the Wise One. Soon he will return
to where the Princess awaits him in the
garden, and presently, my dear Earth
Fairy, the spell that you wrought with
such care will be a thing of naught.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; screamed the Earth Fairy,
&#8220;Never, never shall this be! I must
escape. You must help me to escape at
once, and prevent it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Flying Soot shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I enable you to escape
from a prison so strong, and so securely
locked?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes but a key to open the strongest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
lock,&#8221; insisted the Earth Fairy.
&#8220;You must overpower the keeper. You
must obtain the key&mdash;and let me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the beginning Flying Soot was unwilling
to try, but when the Earth
Fairy presently spoke of rewarding him
for his services, he agreed to do as she
wished.</p>

<p>&#8220;First you must release me,&#8221; commanded
she. &#8220;Then you must hasten to
the Palace of Burning Coals, and bring
forth my bundle of wands from a hiding
place that I will tell you of. When
you have brought them to me, I will
bestow one of them upon you as your
reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Flying Soot knew well that a
Soot Fairy can work no magic with the
wand of a Fire Fairy unless he is taught
its secret. &#8220;Promise that you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
surely show me how to use it,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and I will do as you ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, of course,&#8221; agreed the
Earth Fairy impatiently. &#8220;Only be
swift about your task, and the secret
shall be yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Satisfied with her reply, Flying Soot
went his way. In the darkness of her
cell the Earth Fairy waited, scarcely
able to breathe, so fearful was she that
the Prince might return from the Wise
One and disenchant the Princess before
she had time to interfere.</p>

<p>It was but a little while, however,
before she heard the stealthy footsteps of
Flying Soot returning. It was but a
moment more till she heard the great
key turn in the lock, and saw the door
flung wide open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out quickly,&#8221; whispered her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
deliverer. &#8220;Your keepers, blinded with
soot, grope hither and thither utterly bewildered.
Together we must contrive
to shove them into your prison, and lock
them up in your place. After that you
will be able to go on your way in
safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly, the Earth Fairy sprang to
his help, and so skillfully did the two
evil fairies jostle the keepers against one
another and guide them to the prison
door, that soon they were lodged in the
Earth Fairy&#8217;s cell. Then the key was
turned upon them, and they were left
to grope clumsily about in the darkness,
while the Earth Fairy and her companion
hurried to the safe shelter of a
thicket. There the Earth Fairy told
Flying Soot where she had hidden her
wands, and bade him haste to bring them
to her. When he had departed upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
errand the Earth Fairy huddled low
among the bushes to await his coming
with what patience she might.</p>

<p>In spite of the years that had passed
since the Earth Fairy had hidden her
wands, none had discovered the place
where they lay. So crafty a messenger
was Flying Soot that he obtained them
unseen, and without difficulty, and soon
returned to where the Earth Fairy was
concealed. He laid the bundle in her
outstretched hand.</p>

<p>Trembling with anxiety, the Earth
Fairy opened the case, and ran her
fingers over the wands to test their
power. The Green Wand shot forth
emerald fire from its tip as she took it
from among the rest. It was as full of
magic as on that far-off day when with
it she had so cruelly enchanted the baby
Princess.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>With covetous eyes Flying Soot
looked upon it. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried he, &#8220;that
is the wand of my desire. That shall be
my well-earned reward.&#8221; He stretched
his hand to take it from her, but the
Earth Fairy waved him back with an
imperious gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Touch not the Green Wand,&#8221; she
commanded. &#8220;To do so is to destroy
yourself.&#8221; She laid it back in its place
and took out in it its stead a small dark
wand. This she extended to him saying,
&#8220;Here is the one which is for you.&#8221;
With indignant words he would have
spurned it, but she checked his complaints
abruptly. &#8220;It will serve you
well, if you but know its secret,&#8221; she told
him, &#8220;See&mdash;in this its magic dwells.&#8221;
With a last envious look at the Green
Wand, Flying Soot cast aside his anger,
and watched her narrowly while she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
showed him how to use her gift. Still
a little ungraciously he received it, and
hid it in his mantle.</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy stopping for no farewell,
gathered up her bundle of wands,
and hurried to the spot where Flying
Soot had told her the Princess awaited
the coming of Prince Radiance. There
at the foot of the great fire oak she saw
her, flushing and paling with glorious
light. She was thinking of the wonderful
happiness that had come to her, but
suddenly she became aware that a
stranger was approaching. Looking up
she beheld the Earth Fairy.</p>

<p>Quickly the Earth Fairy advanced
till she stood before the Princess, and
without waiting to be addressed, announced
her errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am a
messenger from Prince Radiance. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
cannot return to you as he had expected;
but he has sent me to ask you to
let me guide you to where he waits for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Princess White Flame regarded her
doubtfully. &#8220;You are a stranger to
me,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;How may I know
that you are in truth a messenger from
the Prince?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; cried the Earth Fairy, &#8220;will
you not trust me? Alas! If you do not,
the Prince can never disenchant you,
for the Wise One has assured him that
unless you come to where Prince Radiance
now awaits you, the Veil will have
no power over you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the Princess regarded
the face of the wicked one closely. It
bore a kind and innocent look. Still
she felt undecided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasten, Your Highness!&#8221; entreated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the Earth Fairy. &#8220;Hasten, I beg of
you, lest its magic be lost to you both.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess White Flame hesitated
no longer. &#8220;Lead on,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I
will follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rejoiced that she had been able to persuade
the Princess so easily, the Earth
Fairy passed at once out of the Garden,
and away from the Palace of Burning
Coals, and close beside her fluttered the
white flame of the Princess.</p>

<p>Silently they traveled, and after a time
the country through which they were
passing began to look strange to the
Princess. Yet, though they went on and
on, she still saw no sign of Prince Radiance.
At last she began to question the
Earth Fairy, who always replied that
they had but a short distance farther
to go.</p>

<p>The lovely flame-colored and yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
trees of the Land of the Fire Fairies had
been left far behind; the little birds that
make a music in the Fire Kingdom like
none elsewhere, were heard no more:
the beautiful palaces, the shining gardens,
where happy fairies worked and
played, had vanished. On all sides rose
dull red caves, huge heaps of ash, or
high black walls of soot, ugly and forbidding.</p>

<p>Hideous creatures crept away into
darkness as they drew near, or peered
out upon them from hiding-places as
they passed.</p>

<p>Princess White Flame shuddered, and
her light grew pale and dim. &#8220;Whither
are you leading me?&#8221; she cried faintly,
&#8220;Answer truly, for I will go no further.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy laughed mockingly.
&#8220;Well may you ask,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Evil
for you was the hour when you left your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
garden to follow me. Behold in me the
Earth Fairy&mdash;your parents&#8217; enemy and
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great trembling seized the unfortunate
Princess. In this terrible land,
helpless in the power of this wicked
fairy, how could she hope ever again to
see the Prince who had won her heart?
How could she hope ever again to return
to her father in the Palace of Burning
Coals?</p>

<p>Coldly and cruelly the voice of the
Earth Fairy came to her in her despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many years was I a prisoner by
King Red Flame&#8217;s command, and dark
and dreary was my cell. Now my turn
for vengeance has come, and you may
be well assured that in the place that I
have chosen for you, neither the beauty
of your voice, nor your flashing brightness
shall avail you aught.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>Before them yawned a black and narrow
cave, its walls hung thick with soot.
From under her cloak the Earth Fairy
drew her Green Wand. She extended it
over the Princess, and pointed to the
cave. &#8220;By the power of my Green
Wand I command you to enter,&#8221; she
cried.</p>

<p>From the wand streamed a magic so
potent that the poor Princess had no
power to resist it. With a low cry of
anguish, she bowed herself, and disappeared
into the darkness of the cave.</p>

<p>Calling all her evil magic to her aid,
the Earth Fairy drew down the walls of
the cave and sealed them. She listened
to make sure that no sound could make
its way from within. Then she returned
her wand to its place, and flitted away
over the desolate plain. As she went she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
murmured gleefully, &#8220;Ah! that was
well done. Now I know for a certainty
that nothing good can ever come to
Princess White Flame.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">HARDLY had Princess White
Flame departed with the Earth
Fairy when Prince Radiance returned
to the garden.</p>

<p>Great was his astonishment to find
the Princess no longer there. Believing,
however, that she had gone but for
a moment he sat down beneath the
flame-red tree to wait for her return.</p>

<p>Many moments passed, and she did
not come, and at last the Prince rose to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
seek her through the garden, calling
softly as he went, &#8220;Princess, dear Princess
White Flame, where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>But none answered him through the
stillness, and again he cried, &#8220;White
Flame, dear White Flame&mdash;it is I,
Prince Radiance. Answer&mdash;ah answer
me!&#8221; Yet up and down the blooming
spaces of the garden he sought her,
and called to her in vain. Presently he
came to a wide avenue, and entering it
found himself erelong before a great
and shining palace. It was the Palace
of Burning Coals, and through its open
doors and windows he could see the Fire
Fairies going to and fro about their
appointed tasks. Hoping that here he
might learn where to find the Princess,
he ascended the steps to the bright door,
and told his errand to the fairy who
guarded it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>&#8220;In this palace dwells the Princess,&#8221;
answered the Fire Fairy. &#8220;She is King
Red Flame&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me to His Majesty then,&#8221; commanded
Prince Radiance, &#8220;for I would
have speech with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he was brought before King Red
Flame without delay. In the great hall
of the Palace sat the King. It was that
time of evening when the Princess was
wont to bear him company, but she had
not yet come, and he was beginning to
wonder why she tarried.</p>

<p>When Prince Radiance, guided by
the Fire Fairy, was shown into the royal
presence the King gave him hearty welcome.
With transports of joy he learned
how the Prince had heard and loved
Princess White Flame in her garden,
how he had gone to obtain the mystic
Veil from the Wise One, and had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
successful where countless who had
come there before him had failed. Great
was the King&#8217;s surprise, however, when
he learned that Prince Radiance had returned
to the garden, only to find the
Princess gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not like my daughter to break
a promise,&#8221; he said, &#8220;especially one of
such great moment. Why she has done
so, I cannot even guess, but I will send
for her at once, and she shall speak for
herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>A messenger was dispatched immediately
to summon the Princess. He was
gone for some time, but at length returned
to say that nowhere in the palace
had he been able to find her.</p>

<p>Then the King sent for Grey Smoke,
for none knew so well as she where her
young mistress was most likely to be
found. Yet though Grey Smoke made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
a most thorough search in every nook
and corner of the palace, though she
went to the top of its highest tower, and
looked anxiously without in every direction,
no where could she catch a glimpse
of that pure white flame that was the
spirit of the Princess, nor hear the music
of her well-loved voice.</p>

<p>When she returned to her master to
say that her quest also had been fruitless,
the King became very much
alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the palace grounds be searched,
once more,&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;Let no
spot be overlooked. Let none rest until
my daughter has been found.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anxiously the Fire Fairies one and all
set forth to seek her. Yet more anxiously
King Red Flame and Prince Radiance
awaited their return.</p>

<p>Suddenly a tumult arose outside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
palace walls, and immediately after the
Earth Fairy&#8217;s head-keeper, his eyes still
half-blinded with soot, stumbled into the
King&#8217;s presence. Close behind him
came a crowd of excited Fire Fairies.
The head-keeper threw himself at King
Red Flame&#8217;s feet. &#8220;Your Majesty! Oh,
Your Majesty!&#8221; he moaned. &#8220;In some
strange manner the wicked Earth Fairy
has escaped, while we, her keepers,
blinded with soot have been imprisoned
in her stead. Forgive us, oh forgive us
we beg, that this should ever have come
to pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Escaped! The Earth Fairy escaped!&#8221;
thundered King Red Flame,
aghast at such evil tidings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Escaped. The Earth Fairy escaped!&#8221;
shrieked all the fairies who
were clustered in the palace hall. &#8220;Oh!
Oh! That this should be!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>Old Grey Smoke bowed her head between
her shoulders. &#8220;If this be true,&#8221;
mourned she, &#8220;then the Princess is indeed
lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Filled with consternation the King
looked down upon the head-keeper still
crouched at his feet. &#8220;Speak,&#8221; he commanded,
&#8220;and tell me how this has come
to pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely Sire, it must have been the
work of a spell,&#8221; began the head-keeper,
&#8220;Nothing else could have brought such
calamity upon us.&#8221; Then he went on
to tell what had happened. As his tale
proceeded the King listened intently,
and all the Fire Fairies drew closer that
they might not miss a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;And by what means have you now
escaped?&#8221; demanded the King, as the
head-keeper paused for breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;But a moment since, Your Majesty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
one of our number contrived to wrench
away the lock of the cell-door, and immediately
I hastened here to warn you
that the Earth Fairy is abroad, and that
the Princess may be in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas!&#8221; groaned King Red Flame,
&#8220;The Earth Fairy is doubtless already
at work, for the Princess is nowhere to
be found.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hearing this, the head-keeper began
to beat himself upon the breast. &#8220;The
Princess lost! The Princess White
Flame lost, and we the cause!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay!&#8221; replied his master sternly,
&#8220;you, the Earth Fairy&#8217;s careless keepers,
were the cause. Had you not deserted
your post, this great misfortune could
never have fallen upon us.&#8221; He turned
to a trusted servant. &#8220;Take away this
faithless keeper,&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;and
place him and his companions under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
strict guard, there to remain until my
daughter, Princess White Flame, is restored
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the keeper was taken away, still
beating his breast, and crying aloud in
vain remorse.</p>

<p>All about the palace hall stood the
Fire Fairies weeping and lamenting,
for the Princess was dearly loved.</p>

<p>Then the King turned to the old
nurse. &#8220;Come, my good Grey Smoke,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;give me of your wise counsel.
How shall I best seek my beloved
daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>But before Grey Smoke could answer,
Prince Radiance sprang to the
King&#8217;s side, and laid his hand upon the
monarch&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he implored, &#8220;remember
that I, also, love the Princess.
I claim the right to seek her, for have I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
not the magic gifts of the Wise One,
and shall not my love guide me to her
rescue? Fear not. By the aid of these
I will surely bring her back to the
Palace of Burning Coals, not as you saw
her last, indeed&mdash;but in her true form,
freed forever from the Earth Fairy&#8217;s
spell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking upon the ardent and hopeful
face of the young Prince, hearing his
earnest words, the heart of King Red
Flame was deeply stirred, and strangely
comforted. He stretched forth his arms,
and drew him to his breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, my son,&#8221; he said, tenderly. &#8220;Go,
and all good fortune follow you. Bring
back my beloved daughter to her home
once more. So shall you gladden her
father&#8217;s heart, and win happiness for
yourself and her.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">BACK across the dismal land
through which she had led the
Princess, flitted the Earth Fairy. Freed
though she now was from her long imprisonment,
she yet hoped for even
greater liberty. When Flying Soot had
told her that the Veil had power to disenchant
the Princess, she felt sure that
it would have a like magic influence
over herself; that if she could but obtain
it, and cast it about her that she should
once more become a true Earth Fairy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Should this come to pass, she would flee
forever from the Land of Fire which
she so hated, to her own people and her
own home.</p>

<p>Therefore she determined to go in
search of the Prince, and by means of
her wands wrest from him the coveted
Veil. She knew that it would soon be
discovered that Princess White Flame
was no longer in her father&#8217;s kingdom,
and she believed that Prince Radiance
would then come to seek the Princess in
the Land of the Evil Fairies. She herself
would be in wait for him near the
boundary and would endeavor to overpower
him there.</p>

<p>So rapidly did she journey that she
soon reached the borders of the Land
of the Fire Fairies, and began to watch
for the coming of the Prince.</p>

<p>Some time had passed before she beheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
a scarlet cloaked figure approaching,
looking eagerly on all sides, as if
in search of someone. From what Flying
Soot had told her she knew that it
was Prince Radiance. She crept to
meet him, concealing herself cleverly
from sight as she went.</p>

<p>When she was but a short distance
from him she stopped and opened her
bundle of wands. She had taken out
the Green Wand, and was about to use
it, when she paused. Well did she know
that she had none other so powerful,
none other that could so fully work her
will. By this she held the Princess completely
under her sway. Upon the
Prince she was unwilling to risk it
unless all else failed. She laid it back
among the rest and took up another that
she had always trusted. Waving it toward
the Prince she murmured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
words of a spell so potent that she expected
to see him fall instantly to the
ground unable to speak or to move. But
it was as though the spell had never been
uttered. The Prince continued on his
way as before, and the Earth Fairy
knew by this that all power had departed
from her wand. She cast it away,
and selecting another without hesitation,
she followed close after him, repeating
the words of her spell. This
time also, the spell was of no avail; the
second wand became as useless as the
first, and was discarded in its turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Truly there must be magic in this
that will overpower him,&#8221; she muttered,
taking out the third. &#8220;Never before has
this one failed me.&#8221; Yet the third wand
had no more power than the rest. One
by one, she tried them all, until there
was none left but the Green Wand. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
looked at it longingly, but dared not
risk it. Should it too be useless before
this mysterious influence that protected
the Prince she would have nothing at all
by which to work her will.</p>

<p>She ceased to follow Prince Radiance,
and sat down to think of what she
should do in order to carry out her purpose.</p>

<p>Pondering deeply, she did not know
that someone had approached her from
behind, and was standing close beside
her. It was Flying Soot. He waited a
few moments but finding that the Earth
Fairy was too much engaged to be
aware of his presence, he tapped her
upon the arm. &#8220;Well, my good friend,&#8221;
he began, &#8220;how have your affairs prospered
since you left me so abruptly in
the palace gardens?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy looked up with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
start. No one had been further from
her thoughts than Flying Soot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not disturb me,&#8221; she answered
impatiently, &#8220;I am thinking over an important
matter in which you can be of
no use to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be too certain of that,&#8221; the
Soot Fairy replied. &#8220;Remember that
you are now in a land where I have
many and powerful friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy had not realized
that. At his words, she suddenly began
to wonder if some of these wicked
fairies of which he spoke, might be able
to help her to obtain what she so desired.
Instantly she changed her tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I believe you
told me of a magic Veil that the Prince
was to obtain from the Wise One. I
have decided that I want this Veil for
myself. I have tried all my wands upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the Prince in an effort to take it from
him, but they have failed. One alone I
have not tried. It is the Green Wand
which rules the Princess White Flame.
This I am unwilling to risk&mdash;for the
present at least. Have you, perhaps,
among your friends, any who is sufficiently
powerful to overcome Prince
Radiance, so that I can take from him
this Veil?&#8221;</p>

<p>Flying Soot threw back his black
mantle from his shoulder with a confident
gesture. &#8220;To be sure I have,&#8221; he
assured her, &#8220;and if the first should not
succeed there are many others who
would be willing to try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one difficulty,&#8221; the Earth
Fairy warned him, &#8220;I can offer no reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not let that trouble you,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;The friends whom I shall ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to assist you are too proud to receive
rewards. They are sufficiently pleased
when they have succeeded in accomplishing
the mischief they set out to perform.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was good news to the Earth
Fairy. Her face shone with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing that you must do,
however,&#8221; continued Flying Soot. &#8220;You
must contrive to lure the Prince to my
friends, for they are far too haughty to
seek him, even to do him harm. Is there
any plan by which you can do this?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a time the Earth Fairy sat
plunged in thought. Then she sprang
up clapping her hands in delight. &#8220;Ay,&#8221;
cried she, &#8220;that I can. I will compel
the Princess herself to lure him on.
Well has my Green Wand proved its
power over her, and she it is who shall
lead him to his destruction.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>&#8220;How shall this be done?&#8221; inquired
her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is simple enough,&#8221; replied the
Earth Fairy. &#8220;You have but to tell me
whither I must bring the Prince. Then
while you have gone to enlist the services
of this friend whom you have
chosen, I will release the Princess, will
seek out the Prince, and bring him by
her influence to the appointed place.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave her most careful instructions
as to where she would find him.
&#8220;And now,&#8221; said he, when he had made
everything clear, &#8220;I go to engage my
friend the Giant of the Wide Grey Plain
to assist you. You need have no fear.
He will agree to do so. As soon as you
arrive with your Prince you will find
him ready.&#8221; He rose from his seat,
shook out his black mantle, and quickly
vanished in the distance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>The Earth Fairy on her part, hastened
to the cave where the Princess White
Flame was imprisoned. Carefully she
unwove the spell which sealed its walls,
and in a loud voice she commanded the
Princess to come forth. Out of the
yawning entrance glimmered the flame,
pale and faint, but still of a pure and
beautiful whiteness.</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy drew out her Green
Wand, and held it aloft. &#8220;Go where I
bid you,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;and delay not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unable to resist the spell of the Green
Wand, the Princess without word or
sound, flitted rapidly away with her enchantress
to seek the Prince.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Prince Radiance, knowing
nothing of the attempt that the Earth
Fairy had already made to destroy him,
proceeded on his quest. All across the
Wide Grey Plain where he now was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
are scattered hills and mounds of ash
in great number, and so much alike in
size and shape are they, that the traveler
often becomes confused and knows not
which way to direct his steps. Thus it
was with Prince Radiance, and at last
quite bewildered he stood still, and
looked about him, seeking for something
to guide him. It was while he did
so, that suddenly he saw gleaming in the
distance a flame so pure and lovely that
he could not doubt that it was the spirit
of his Princess. In an ecstasy of joy he
threw out his arms to it. &#8220;White Flame!
Ah my beloved White Flame,&#8221; he cried,
&#8220;can it be that I have in truth found you
so much sooner than I had dared to
hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly he hastened toward her,
drawing nearer and yet nearer until he
was sure that she could hear his voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>&#8220;Princess,&#8221; he called to her. &#8220;Wait,
ah, wait until I reach you. See, it is I,
Prince Radiance, who follow. I bring
with me the Veil that is to set you free.&#8221;
He expected her to pause; but it was
not so. Slowly, yet steadily she retreated
from him, and as she went her well-loved
voice floated back to him, not singing
sweetly, as when he had heard it in her
garden, but weeping, and in anguish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah me, ah me, dear Radiance!&#8221; she
sobbed, &#8220;the Earth Fairy has cast a
second and more cruel spell upon me,
that causes me to flee as you draw near.&#8221;</p>

<p>So overwhelmed with grief was the
Prince by the news of this fresh misfortune
that at first he was stricken dumb,
but presently hope and courage sprang
afresh within his breast.</p>

<p>Across the distance that widened between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
them his answer rang tender and
undismayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go where you must, my Princess, I
will surely follow. No power, however
strong, no spell, however potent, can suffice
to daunt my love. Believe always
that I will surely overtake and save you
in the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Princess White Flame heard him, and
took comfort. The Earth Fairy heard
him, and rejoiced, for now she knew
that without doubt she could lead him
where she would. Keeping herself out
of sight, she drove the Princess away
and away in the direction that Flying
Soot had gone, and unswervingly Prince
Radiance pursued the ever brightening
flame.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AWAY went Flying Soot at full speed
until he came to the Seven Hills
of Ash. There in a great hollow between
them crouched the Giant of the
Wide Grey Plain. He was grumbling
and grumbling to himself, for no one
had invited him to join them in any evil
magic for a long while. So he was having
a terribly stupid time of it, and
wished with all his heart that something
would happen that would give him a
chance to show his power.</p>

<p>Flying Soot stole up to him unseen,
and softly touched his elbow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>The Giant turned with so tremendous
a start that masses of ash were shaken
loose from the Seven Hills, and fell in
clouds into the hollow. &#8220;So it is you,
Flying Soot!&#8221; he cried joyfully. &#8220;That
means there is good prospect of mischief
afoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; replied Flying Soot, &#8220;that
there is.&#8221; He found a seat on a soft
bank close to the Giant, who at once
prepared himself to hear interesting
news.</p>

<p>Flying Soot began forthwith to tell
him about the Earth Fairy, who he said
had sent him to ask the Giant&#8217;s aid
against a young Prince who would soon
be traveling that way. &#8220;He will be preceded
by a flame, who is the enchanted
Princess whom he loves,&#8221; said he. &#8220;She
it is, who, under the Earth Fairy&#8217;s spell,
leads him on to danger. We wish you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to destroy the Prince if you can. At
any rate you must completely overpower
him, in order that the Earth Fairy may
take from him a Veil which he carries,
and which she greatly covets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely this Veil must be endowed
with marvelous power,&#8221; exclaimed the
Giant, &#8220;if the Earth Fairy is so anxious
to secure it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; Flying Soot made haste to
answer; &#8220;but it possesses this power only
in the hands of the Prince, or of the
Earth Fairy. To you or to others it
would be of no use whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; growled the Giant, &#8220;she
may have it and welcome for all I care.
Why should I wish for a wretched Veil
so long as I have my Cloak with which
to work my will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you, indeed?&#8221; agreed
the Soot Fairy. &#8220;What is a trifle like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Veil, compared to a Cloak so wonderful
as yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>Flattered by the words of Flying Soot,
the Giant was now ready to exert himself
to the utmost, and could hardly wait
for the arrival of the Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sure that you do no harm to the
Princess,&#8221; Flying Soot warned him.
&#8220;The Earth Fairy herself will see to her.
It is the Prince alone upon whom you
are to exercise your power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall remember,&#8221; replied the Giant.
&#8220;Say no more, but come and watch for
them with me. Through this opening between
the Seven Hills we can surely see
them as they approach.&#8221; Flying Soot
did as the Giant bade him and together
they watched and waited for some time.</p>

<p>At last, in the distance, they beheld a
flashing brightness coming steadily toward
the place where they lay in wait,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and close behind it followed a figure
well known to Flying Soot.</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; he whispered, gripping the
Giant&#8217;s arm. &#8220;The Princess comes, and
the Prince hastens after. There also is
my friend the Earth Fairy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; answered the Giant with a
malicious chuckle. &#8220;They are coming
fast. Go farther from me, Flying Soot,
that I may have room to use my Cloak.&#8221;
Flying Soot obeyed, and the Giant began
to make ready.</p>

<p>He loosed his huge grey Cloak from
his neck, dragged it from his shoulders,
and gathered its collar firmly in his
hand. Then he crouched down once
more behind the hill nearest to the approaching
travelers. So like to the
ashes in color was the Giant&#8217;s great
body that he was almost indistinguishable,
as with eyes glued to the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in the side of the hill, he awaited the
moment when the Prince should arrive.</p>

<p>Prince Radiance gave heed only to
the Princess. With his gaze fixed upon
her flashing light, he followed its guidance
across the Wide Grey Plain. As
he sped on and on, he kept ever before
him the hope that by some means he
might be able to bridge the distance between
them. So, before he realized it,
he had reached the Seven Hills of Ash,
and the danger that lurked behind them.</p>

<p>The Giant&#8217;s time had come. Silently,
swiftly he rose, and towered above the
hills that had sheltered him. With a
sweep of his mighty arm he flung out
his cloak and cast it like a grey wall between
the Prince and the Princess.
Deftly he caught Prince Radiance in its
folds, and before the Prince could
make the least effort to free himself, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Giant raised his Cloak high in air, and
set it spinning about his head like an
enormous revolving cloud. Larger it
grew, flying faster and faster the while,
and at every turn its stifling folds settled
closer about the captive Prince.</p>

<p>The hoarse laughter of the Giant
roared in his ears like thunder. Half
choked, the Prince beat back the Cloak
from his face, and struggled violently
to escape. But round and round spun
the Cloak as the Giant whirled his
powerful arm, and Prince Radiance
only exhausted himself against its
tightening clasp, in vain.</p>

<p>The Giant&#8217;s dull eyes began to glitter
for he knew that none could resist his
evil Cloak for very long. Safe hidden
within the hollow between the Hills of
Ash, Flying Soot peered out upon them,
and near him hovered the cruel Earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Fairy, ready to dart out and seize the
treasure that she coveted as soon as the
Giant&#8217;s victory was gained. Princess
White Flame, stricken with grief and
dismay at the sudden disappearance of
the Prince, quivered alone and helpless
where the Earth Fairy held her in
thrall.</p>

<p>Gladly the Prince would have drawn
his sword to slash his way through the
Giant&#8217;s great Cloak, but he could not
free his arms sufficiently to do so. Thus
he seemed entirely without a weapon
that he could use in his own defense, and
he was about to give himself up for lost,
when suddenly he remembered the Grey
Pouch at his side. He remembered also
the words of the giver, &#8220;It will help you
out of many a danger&mdash;out of many a
difficulty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May it not be that it will help me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
now?&#8221; murmured the Prince faintly,
&#8220;Ah, if it does not, then all hope of
escape is gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>By a great effort he slipped his hand
down to his side. With shaking fingers
he undid the clasp of his Pouch and
reached for the glowing coal that lay
within. He drew it forth, and felt, as he
did so that it was on fire with magic.
He pressed it against the Giant&#8217;s Cloak.
Immediately a hole appeared in its folds,
which widened rapidly. The air rushed
in, reviving the Prince with its freshness
and giving him zeal and new courage.
So well did he use his weapon then, that
presently he had before him a great
opening in the thick folds through
which he could pass with ease.</p>

<p>The Cloak in the Giant&#8217;s hands was
still whirling at tremendous speed.
Prince Radiance, looking out through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the opening saw the Seven Hills of Ash
and the Wide Grey Plain spinning
dizzily round and round far beneath
him. Yet he was not afraid. He prepared
himself to leap from the opening
that he had made, when suddenly the
Giant hurled his Cloak violently forward.
Instantly the Prince was thrown
through the air with such force that he
was driven far out of reach or sight of
his enemies. His scarlet mantle spread
itself about him like great wings that
bore him swiftly on and on, until at last
it settled slowly and allowed him to
alight in a place of safety.</p>

<p>The Giant, unaware that Prince Radiance
was no longer in his power,
gave his huge Cloak an abrupt twist.
Immediately it shrunk to its former size,
and he threw it down into the hollow between
the Seven Hills. Then he turned
to the Earth Fairy triumphantly.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>&#8220;Come now, and take what you desire,&#8221;
he roared, &#8220;for this miserable
Prince is without doubt completely destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Forth rushed the wicked Earth Fairy
in a tremor of delight, sure that she was
about to possess the Veil. With greedy
hands she flung aside the folds of the
Giant&#8217;s Cloak; with greedy hands she
searched within its folds; but search as
she would, she could find nothing.
Unable to believe in such ill-fortune she
tore the Cloak to right and left, but at
last she knew for a certainty that the
Prince was not there.</p>

<p>In a rage she turned upon the Giant.
&#8220;Miserable creature, see what you have
done!&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;With the Prince
completely in your grasp as he was, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
have been so stupid as to allow him to
escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Giant could not believe it possible.
He stooped over the Cloak, and
himself examined each one of its great
folds, but at last he was convinced that
the Earth Fairy was right. The Prince
was indeed gone, and the great hole
burned in the Cloak showed plainly the
manner of his escape. Vexed as he was,
his vexation changed quickly to anger
as the Earth Fairy continued to pour
contempt upon him for his failure, and
to upbraid Flying Soot for having
brought her to so worthless an ally.</p>

<p>Springing up in uncontrollable fury
at her insolence, the Giant shouted
threats at her at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>Flying Soot saw that he must interfere
at once. He bent down and whispered
quickly to the Earth Fairy, &#8220;Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
not tarry here an instant longer. You
have made an enemy of the Giant. In
another moment he will destroy us all.
Come, let us go in quest of the Prince,
for I have other friends who may serve
you better than the Giant.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crafty Earth Fairy perceived that
he was right, and yielded herself at once
to his advice. Away she fled with Flying
Soot across the Wide Grey Plain,
taking with her the sorrowing Princess,
and soon the Giant and his rage, and
the Seven Hills of Ash lay far behind
them.</p>

<p>At last Flying Soot checked the Earth
Fairy&#8217;s flight. &#8220;Let us stop here while I
tell you what I mean to do,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy was willing. She
rested her Green Wand, and Princess
White Flame ceased to go forward, but
her captor made sure that the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
was not near enough to herself and Flying
Soot to overhear anything that
might be said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince as you know, has escaped
by the work of a magic coal,&#8221;
began Flying Soot. &#8220;Against such a
fairy weapon the Giant&#8217;s wondrous
Cloak is powerless. But come&mdash;I will
take you to one who will be proof
against this&mdash;one whose weapons are
such that the Prince cannot even approach
him to injure him. This powerful
friend of whom I speak is the Great
Black Dragon, and his haunt is yonder
in the Gloomy Vale. From here, as you
see, it is not far distant. I will go at
once to bespeak his aid. Go you, on
your part, and find the Prince, and when
you have brought him to the Dragon,
you may be sure that you will find him
ready to serve you. Then shall you discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
also that I have not boasted of the
Dragon&#8217;s power in vain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glad was the Earth Fairy to consent
to what promised so well for her purpose,
and presently they parted, each to
go upon the errand set.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the Gloomy Vale the Great Black
Dragon lay asleep with his head between
his paws. Around him, on all
sides, stretched the black hillsides, with
apparently no living creature but the
Dragon to be seen.</p>

<p>Yet as Flying Soot entered the valley
on his mission for the Earth Fairy, dull-hued
toads hopped away from his feet,
and strange animals of hideous shapes
left the nooks where they had lain sleeping
to creep away and drowse again in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
a more distant spot. Occasionally he
saw fierce eyes glare out upon him from
a dim thicket, or beheld the sharp claw
or lashing tail of some evil creature
whisking itself away from his view.</p>

<p>Flying Soot knew them all, and feared
them not. He passed unmolested on his
way, and stopped within a yard of the
Dragon, but so profound was the monster&#8217;s
sleep that he did not stir.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awake, Sir Dragon!&#8221; cried Flying
Soot, drawing nearer, &#8220;Awake!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Dragon moved one claw a little
in his slumber, but gave no other heed.</p>

<p>Flying Soot drew nearer still.
&#8220;Awake, Sir Dragon! Awake!&#8221; he
shouted in his very ear.</p>

<p>Then the Dragon gave a great yawn,
and his eyelids slowly rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it is you, Flying Soot,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
grunted. &#8220;What is it that brings you
here to disturb my rest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I come on an errand of importance,&#8221;
answered the Soot Fairy. &#8220;One in
which none can give such valuable aid
as the Great Black Dragon of the
Gloomy Vale.&#8221;</p>

<p>His words pleased the Dragon. He
moistened his lips and cheeks with his
great tongue, and sat erect upon his
haunches. &#8220;Let me hear your errand,&#8221;
commanded he.</p>

<p>So Flying Soot made haste to explain
why he had come, and the Dragon immediately
agreed to help the Earth
Fairy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I shall vanquish
this Prince quickly, you shall see, for
when I choose to use them I have
weapons of such power that none can
stand out against them. Have no fear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Flying Soot. Trust all to me, and I assure
you that you and your friend the
Earth Fairy, shall not be disappointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking upon the monster&#8217;s huge
form, his terrible claws, his fiercely
lashing tail, Flying Soot knew that the
Great Black Dragon had good cause to
boast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I leave the matter entirely to you,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;There is one thing more,
however, that you must promise me.
You must on no account harm, or even
touch the fairy Veil of which I have told
you. Least of all must you attempt to
take it for yourself. I assure you that
it is of no value to any but the Prince
or the Earth Fairy. For others it will
work no charm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Dragon laughed loud and scornfully.
&#8220;That matters naught to me,&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;By the weapons that I carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
always with me I am able to accomplish
what things I please. Why then should
I wish for a trifle like this Veil?&#8221;</p>

<p>His mind entirely at rest upon that
score, Flying Soot now sat himself
down upon a black hillock close to the
Dragon, and sought to entertain him as
they waited by giving him such bits of
news as he had collected in his travels.
The Dragon well pleased to have him
do so, listened hungrily to every word.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Prince Radiance, alone
in a strange land, and still weary from
his struggle with the Giant, sunk down
upon a heap of ash and bowed his head.
He wished to ponder well his course,
before he again set out. Behind him
lay that part of the Wide Grey Plain
where the Giant dwelt who had so lately
tried to destroy him. Before him, and
at his left stretched a plain of ash. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
his right a black country opened with
low lying hills and valleys wherein
might lurk unseen dangers for them
both.</p>

<p>As he sat there in indecision, the
Earth Fairy coming in search of him,
espied him from afar.</p>

<p>Princess White Flame saw him also,
and uttered a cry of joy. She needed
not the spur of the Earth Fairy&#8217;s wand
to drive her to him. Swiftly across the
desolate waste she flitted until he was
within sound of her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Radiance, dear Radiance!&#8221; she
called to him, &#8220;What happiness is mine
that I have found you once more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hearing that well-loved voice the
Prince raised his head quickly and saw
the Princess, not fleeing from him, but
advancing toward him. Instantly he
leaped to his feet, with arms outstretched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
crying in rapture, &#8220;Nay my
Princess, what happiness is mine that
you have returned to me once more!&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran to her at full-speed and had
well-nigh reached her, when suddenly
Princess White Flame was again made
sensible of the restraining wand of the
Earth Fairy. Cruelly, inexorably, it
drew her steadily away from the Prince
into the black country at his right.</p>

<p>Seeing the distance widening between
them the Prince cried aloud with grief
and disappointment. Sore as was his
own heart, Prince Radiance nevertheless
called to her tenderly, hoping to
support and comfort her. &#8220;Fear not,
dearest White Flame,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Whither you go, there will I go also,
and in the end my love shall conquer
every spell.&#8221;</p>

<p>At his words the courage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Princess rose again, and with it came
hope, even though she shivered as they
presently entered that dark valley where
the Dragon dwelt. At first it appeared
to them quite deserted, for so close the
monster lay to the black ground that he
looked to be but a part of the vale itself.
Thus White Flame passed over him and
beyond him without suspecting his presence,
and Prince Radiance in his turn
had advanced almost to the Dragon&#8217;s
feet before he saw what lay in wait to
bar his way.</p>

<p>Aghast at the sudden appearance of
this new foe, Prince Radiance fell back
a pace to place himself on guard, scarce
knowing how to defend himself against
an enemy so ferocious.</p>

<p>Then up rose the Dragon, black and
terrible, a creature to strike terror to one
less valiant than the Prince. &#8220;Yield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
you, Sir Prince,&#8221; he bellowed hoarsely,
raising his bared claw in menace,
&#8220;Yield to the Master of the Gloomy
Vale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I yield to none,&#8221; retorted Prince Radiance,
fearlessly, &#8220;for I follow the
Princess White Flame, and to her I
must pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None passes where the Great Black
Dragon bars the way,&#8221; roared his
enemy, &#8220;and none defies him but learns
to rue his folly.&#8221; He crouched to
spring; his hard and glittering eyes
were fixed angrily upon the Prince, his
tail lashed furiously from side to side.</p>

<p>The Prince knew that he must defend
himself without delay if he would escape
destruction. Quickly he slipped his
hand beneath his mantle to his good
Grey Pouch, opened it, and drew forth
a brimming handful of the fairy ash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
that lay within. Thus was he armed
against his foe.</p>

<p>It was none too soon, for with a roar
that shook the black hillsides the
Dragon sprang toward him with outstretched
claws. The magic ash of the
Wise One flew from the hand of Prince
Radiance, and met him half-way. It
fell full upon the bulging eye-balls of
the Great Dragon, and smote him with
instant blindness. A howl of astonishment
and rage burst from him, but he
was undismayed. Although he could
no longer see to direct his weapons, he
struck out boldly with his claw. Again
the ashes met him and at their touch the
Dragon&#8217;s terrible claw withered and
fell powerless at his side. One by one
his remaining claws met with the same
fate. And now no weapon remained to
him but his powerful tail&mdash;that great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
tail with which he had thought to beat
the Prince to finest dust.</p>

<p>But blinded as he was, he could strike
only at random&mdash;could only lash it aimlessly
from side to side. Thus, the
Dragon&#8217;s last weapon was soon rendered
powerless also. Before the magic
of the fairy ash it shriveled at the very
root, and presently it trailed limp and
useless along the ground.</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy, watching the battle,
saw that the Dragon had also failed, and
anger rose hot within her. Flying Soot
was quick to perceive this, and hastened
to conciliate her. He tapped her gently,
upon the arm saying: &#8220;My good Earth
Fairy, to my great surprise I find that
the Great Black Dragon is no match for
the Prince after all. But do not let that
discourage you. I have yet another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
friend to whom I will take you, who is
much more powerful than he.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy cut him short in
wrath. &#8220;Were you not certain that the
Giant could help me?&#8221; said she. &#8220;Were
you not equally certain that this wonderful
Dragon was invincible? Speak
not to me of this third friend of yours,
I have no faith in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; answered Flying Soot, &#8220;but
how should I know that the Prince possessed
the fairy ash of the Wise One?
This alone it is that has enabled him to
overcome the Black Dragon. Neither
this, nor the magic coal with which he
burned the Giant&#8217;s cloak will avail him
however against the great magician,
Curling Smoke, to whom I now propose
to take you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; replied the Earth
Fairy, &#8220;he wears a sword. Do you not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
see it? Who knows what fairy virtue
may dwell therein?&#8221;</p>

<p>Flying Soot laughed her to scorn.
&#8220;Think you that if it possessed such
fairy virtue that he would not long since
have drawn this sword to cleave the
Giant&#8217;s cloak, or to attack the Great
Dragon? Nay, fear it not. &#8217;Tis but a
useless toy that he well knows will serve
him not at all away from his father&#8217;s
kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy glanced to where
the flame of the Princess trembled between
hope and fear for the Prince. She
looked to where the Dragon groaning
dismally lay close along the ground, his
head buried between his paws. She
knew that here all chance of help for
herself was completely gone. She had
no plan of her own that promised more
than this of Flying Soot. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
almost decided to consent to his proposal,
when he caught at her sleeve.
&#8220;Look quickly!&#8221; he cried, under his
breath. &#8220;Do you not behold him there
in the distance, my friend, Curling
Smoke. See&mdash;there he rises in the plain
beyond that dark hill. He is a marvelous
magician. I am certain that he will
not fail you. Do not be foolish, Earth
Fairy. Permit me to go to him in your
behalf. I assure you, you will not regret
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Urged thus, the Earth Fairy gave her
consent, and Flying Soot flew off in a
twinkling upon his errand of evil.</p>

<p>With the Dragon now fully vanquished
Prince Radiance saw that he
could at last pass on his way in safety.
Leaving his enemy behind him he
stepped boldly into the country beyond.
There he discerned the flame of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Princess flickering pure and pale
against a gloomy hillside. Swiftly he
hastened toward her, and presently he
found himself so near that he believed
he could cast the Veil upon her from
where he now stood. Trembling with
eagerness he felt for the golden box in
which the wondrous Veil lay hid&mdash;found
it, and pressed upon the clasp.</p>

<p>Alas for his hopes! The keen eyes of
the Earth Fairy saw what he was about
to do. Before he could draw out the
Veil or even undo the clasp, the Green
Wand was lifted, and by its dread power
the Princess was once more compelled
to take her flight from him who would
fain have delivered her.</p>

<p>With a sinking heart Prince Radiance
beheld her receding down the dark
valley, but with fresh rallying of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
courage he called to her, &#8220;Princess, dear
Princess, go if you must, but remember
always that I follow&mdash;follow to the
end.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHERE the Gloomy Vale borders
the plain beyond, rises the low-walled
dwelling of the Ash Goblin.</p>

<p>So low it lies that only those familiar
with that land know of its presence.
Only those with eyes accustomed to the
grey stretches can see the Ash Goblin
himself. Very small he is, and grey of
face and eyes and hair. Grey, too, are
his garments, soft and grey as the ashes
that surround him.</p>

<p>So he moves about, concealed from
the view of all but his friends. Not less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
eager than the rest of the Evil Fairies is
he to join in any mischief, but because
he is so small and weak, his help is less
often sought than is that of the more
powerful fairies of the land.</p>

<p>Flying Soot had no intention of asking
him to join in the affairs of the Earth
Fairy. He had not even thought of
him. On many former occasions as he
had passed through the Land of the Evil
Fairies he had stopped to chat with the
Ash Goblin, and give him the news, but
to-day he had not time for so much as
a glance at the grey walls of his
dwelling.</p>

<p>The Ash Goblin seated beside his
door saw him as he approached, and
saw too that he intended to pass without
speaking. Astonished and displeased
he determined not to permit it. He
sprang to his feet in haste, and caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
at the fluttering mantle of the Soot Fairy
to drag him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho there,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;On what
errand of mischief are you bound, that
you do not even give me good-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray let me go at once,&#8221; answered
Flying Soot impatiently, with a jerk of
his mantle, &#8220;I have business of importance
that must not be delayed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is of this important business
that I wish to hear,&#8221; insisted the Ash
Goblin, clutching his raiment only the
more firmly.</p>

<p>Flying Soot knew well that one so insignificant
as the Ash Goblin could do
little to further the wishes of the Earth
Fairy. So he put him off. &#8220;It is an adventure,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;in which you cannot
be of the smallest use to me. Let me go
then to where I can get the help that I
need.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>At this the Ash Goblin became exceedingly
affronted, and was at no pains
to conceal it. &#8220;If it is a matter in which
you require assistance you do ill to despise
mine,&#8221; he declared, drawing himself
up haughtily.</p>

<p>But Flying Soot did not tarry to argue
the matter. He wrenched free his
mantle, and hurried away to seek Curling
Smoke, leaving the Ash Goblin to
nurse his wrath at his leisure.</p>

<p>Wavering and swaying in the plain
beyond the dark hill where Flying Soot
had first beheld him, hung Curling
Smoke, the grey magician. In all the
Land of the Evil Fairies there were few
who possessed such power as he, or were
so ready to wield it.</p>

<p>Even at this moment he was watching
craftily for a chance to work ill upon
whoever might come his way, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
crouching low to peer between the hills,
now rising to the full spire of his height
to overlook the black valleys, and ashy
plains.</p>

<p>Thus he caught sight of Flying Soot
from afar, and waited for him, for well
he knew that mischief was afoot wherever
that black mantle flew.</p>

<p>Flying Soot came fast, calling to him
as he drew near. &#8220;Curling Smoke,
Curling Smoke, do not depart! I have
urgent business with you.&#8221; Nothing
that he could have said would have been
more pleasing to Curling Smoke, and
when the Soot Fairy reached him he
waved him to a seat, settled himself
down beside him and gave him an attentive
ear.</p>

<p>Glad to find his wicked friend so ready
to listen, Flying Soot began. &#8220;A Prince is
traveling through this land&mdash;a stranger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
He pursues a flame, who is an enchanted
Princess whom he hopes to win as a
bride by delivering her from the spell
that binds her. This he expects to do by
means of a magic Veil which he carries.
My friend the Earth Fairy, who is not
far distant, purposes to prevent this, for
she has good cause to desire vengeance
upon the Princess because of injuries
that she herself has suffered from the
parents of this Princess. Moreover, the
Earth Fairy wishes the Veil for herself.
It is for you, greatest magician in all this
land, to vanquish this presumptuous
Prince so that the Earth Fairy may take
from him this Veil. You must give
your word, however, that no matter
what means you may employ to conquer
him, that you will neither injure the Veil
itself, nor seek to deprive the Earth
Fairy of it. Indeed, in case you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
attempt it, you would find that it would
have no virtue in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>In proud disdain Curling Smoke
made answer: &#8220;Bring hither your
Prince, and when I have conquered him
the Earth Fairy may take from him his
Veil and go where she wishes. What
care I for such a miserable trifle as this
Prince carries? Have I not my Veil
that Blinds? Have I not also my Veil
that Chokes? With these two I am able
to work what magic I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I can well believe,&#8221; spoke Flying
Soot in flattering tones. &#8220;As to the
Prince&mdash;I need not go to fetch him.
The Princess herself, driven by the
Earth Fairy&#8217;s spell, leads him on. See
you&mdash;even now they approach us. A
moment more, and they will be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was as he said. Straight toward
them came the beautiful flame of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Princess, and behind her sped Prince
Radiance still cherishing the hope that
the fortunate moment would soon arrive
when he should be able to overtake
her. Hidden from the eyes of the
Prince, but clearly visible to Curling
Smoke and Flying Soot came the wicked
Earth Fairy, eager to test the power of
her new ally. Within the shelter of a
black crag Curling Smoke sank down
and lay concealed until the Princess had
flitted by, but when Prince Radiance
would have done likewise, the tall grey
form of the magician stole from his
hiding-place and filled the path.
Twisted about his arm and trailing from
it were the smoke veils in which his
power dwelt. Delaying not he unloosed
the Veil that Blinds. &#8220;Yield you to
Curling Smoke, to Curling Smoke,
Magician of Veils,&#8221; he cried.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>Tall and powerful as was the unexpected
enemy who now beset him,
Prince Radiance did not quail. Quickly
he laid his hand upon his scabbard and
his voice rang clear, &#8220;Magician though
you be, I fear you not. Neither do I
obey. Stand back then from my path,
for I follow the Princess White Flame,
and yield to none.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curling Smoke gave no word in answer
but flung his veil of smoke instead
full in the Prince&#8217;s face. He thought to
see it sting his eyes to instant blindness,
but it was not so. Before it could come
near him to do him harm the Sword of
Flames answering its master&#8217;s hand had
leapt from its scabbard, and was raised
on high. Back from its splendor the
Veil that Blinds drifted&mdash;drifted&mdash;till it
settled limp across the magician&#8217;s arm.
By the mere lifting of that fairy sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
its power had been scattered, and its
magic spent. Curling Smoke beheld it
with astonishment and anger. Yet he
did not hesitate. Grimly he snatched
from his arm the Veil that Chokes, and
flung it in its turn toward the Prince.
He looked to have it take from Prince
Radiance his very breath, so great was
its pungent stifling power. But this also
failed for the Sword of Flames met and
clove it, and striking to right and left
rent it in pieces. It fell in a thousand
fragments about the magician&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p class="caption">The Sword of Flames leapt from its scabbard and was raised on high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Curling Smoke in a frenzy of
wrath sprang upon the Prince to clutch
him with his arms and bear him down.</p>

<p>Swiftly did Prince Radiance meet his
onset, and right valiantly did he wield
his Sword of Flames. Though Curling
Smoke put forth all his craft, though he
writhed now here, now there, seeking to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
ensnare the Prince, though he towered
above him at one instant or in the next
curled about his knees to drag him to
the earth, yet everywhere the shining
Sword sharp and invincible met him.
Everywhere its violet splendor flashed;
around him and through him, until at
last the magician&#8217;s very form was scattered
and driven away in floating wisps
of smoke.</p>

<p>Prince Radiance sheathed his Sword
of Flames. Before him lay the open
path, and not far away hovered the
Princess. Across the space between
them came her exquisite voice, calling
tremulously her joy at his new deliverance
from peril, and the fear for him
that had been hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, then, my White Flame,&#8221; he answered,
&#8220;fear not for me ever. But one
grief have I&mdash;that I have not yet overtaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
you; but one fear is mine&mdash;that I
may lose you in my journeyings. Over
both of these, hope, like a star, shines
always. Happiness awaits us in the
end. Doubt it not.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy berating Flying
Soot over the utter failure of Curling
Smoke, was arrested by the words of
the Prince.</p>

<p>They but made her the more determined
to achieve her end. Already the
Prince was advancing toward the Princess.
Should he overtake her all was
lost to herself. Quickly she lifted her
Green Wand and drove Princess White
Flame onward. Quickly she turned to
Flying Soot who had been making a
new offer. &#8220;Go then,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;and
seek this Wizard of the Cave of Darkness,
of whom you have spoken. Obtain
his assistance for me. We shall not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
be far behind you, so lose no time. Let
us hope that this last plan of yours will
be of more value to me than the others
that you have suggested.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flying Soot needed no second bidding,
but took himself off in the direction
of the Wizard&#8217;s Cave. More slowly
the Earth Fairy proceeded along the
same way, keeping the Prince and the
Princess ever before her.</p>

<p>They had scarcely left the spot where
Curling Smoke had been vanquished,
when a small grey figure stole out from
a crevice in a rock near by and looked
cautiously after them. It was the Ash
Goblin. He shook his fist at them in
menace, muttering, &#8220;We shall see, Flying
Soot, we shall see, Earth Fairy,
whether you can afford to scorn the help
of one so small even as an Ash Goblin.&#8221;
He sat down upon a low rock to watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the floating remnants that had once been
Curling Smoke. Patiently he waited,
for knowing this crafty magician, he
knew also what would come to pass.
Slowly, slowly these remnants came
closer and closer. Slowly they gathered
themselves bit by bit into one mass, and
at length before the Ash Goblin&#8217;s eyes
Curling Smoke appeared once more in
his own shape. He who had so lately
boasted himself to be invincible, held
himself haughtily, for anger burned
within him at his humiliation and he
was determined to be revenged. It
pleased the Ash Goblin to see him thus,
for it fell in with his own purposes.
Fearful lest Curling Smoke should be
about to depart he made haste to address
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Magician,&#8221; he called from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
his lowly seat, &#8220;do you know what Flying
Soot has said of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not Flying Soot who concerns
me,&#8221; answered Curling Smoke, not
deigning to look down at the speaker.
&#8220;It is this Prince whom I mean to punish
for what he has lately done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but it was Flying Soot whom I
heard telling the Earth Fairy that he
might have guessed that you were no
magician after all, but a mere boaster.
He declared also that he had other
friends who would help her, who were
really more powerful, and whose word
could be trusted. Many other things he
said, that put shame and contempt upon
you. It would take too long to repeat
them all. Does not Flying Soot concern
you, now that you know this,
Master Magician?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much does he concern me that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
shall punish him as well,&#8221; replied Curling
Smoke, in mounting rage. &#8220;Ay,
and the Earth Fairy, also. Before their
journey is done&mdash;in a moment when
they look not for me, they shall one and
all find that the power of Curling Smoke
is not to be despised.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Ash Goblin clapped his hands in
a burst of wicked glee. &#8220;Ah, Master
Magician, that I can well believe&mdash;and
I&mdash;the Ash Goblin&mdash;shall make it my
business to be there to see it.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">STRANGE though the lands had
been across which Prince Radiance
had journeyed since he left his
father&#8217;s kingdom, the one through
which the flame now led him was the
strangest of all. At one time he thought
himself to be approaching a great
palace, not brilliant and glittering like
the Palace of Burning Coals, but looming
dark and forbidding before his eyes.
He wondered what manner of danger
might await him there; yet when at last
he stood before it, it dissolved from before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
his sight as though it had never been.
And beyond him, hastening toward a
gloomy forest the flame of his Princess
still seemed to lead on.</p>

<p>He reached the forest, and it, too,
vanished into thin air, while before him
the pale flame steadily pursued its way.</p>

<p>A great black cave became visible in
the distance. Soon the flame reached it
and disappeared into its mouth, yet
when the Prince arrived, no cave was
there, and flitting on in silence went the
unresting flame. Thus he was deceived
again and again, for whatever he saw
was found to be naught as soon as he
reached it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saw I never so curious a land!&#8221; murmured
the Prince. &#8220;Surely but a moment
since I seemed to see a strange grey
woman close by my side; yet now she is
gone.&#8221; He turned to assure himself of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
it, and as he did so, a faint laugh echoed
through the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I was not mistaken after all,&#8221;
he whispered. &#8220;Someone laughed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, yet farther off, he heard the
same echoing laugh, but though he
looked sharply in the direction from
whence it came, he still saw nothing.
Paying no further heed to it Prince Radiance
traveled onward with greater
speed. Now at last he found that he
was truly overtaking the flame. At
times it stood still, then went slowly on,
but finally, as if it meant to go no further
it burned steadily in one spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;She waits!&#8221; exclaimed Radiance.
&#8220;My Princess waits!&#8221; He ran to her,
his heart filled with dread lest she should
again take flight. He reached her, and
opened his box in haste. He took the
magic Veil from its shelter, and shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
its transparent folds over the waiting
flame. Instantly the flame vanished,
and Radiance watched with eager eyes
for the appearance of his Princess in
her true form.</p>

<p>But moment followed moment, the
Veil drooped limp from his hand, and
though the flame was gone, the Princess
did not become visible.</p>

<p>Perceiving that he had been deceived
once more, Prince Radiance cried aloud
in his grief, &#8220;Alas! This also is nothing!
I have followed a false flame!&#8221;</p>

<p>Overcome with pain and discouragement,
he dropped the Veil unheeded to
the ground, and buried his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>A long grey shadow crept toward him
from the gloom, and once more a faint
laugh broke the stillness. It was so near
that it startled the Prince, plunged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
though he was in distress. He took his
hands quickly from his eyes, and saw the
creeping shadow, saw that with long
arms outstretched it sought to reach and
steal the mystic Veil that lay unprotected
at his feet. Swiftly he bent, and
snatched the Veil to himself. He restored
it to the golden box, and fastened
the box safely beneath his cloak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; breathed a voice from the
shadow, &#8220;you were too quick for me. I
so much longed to see closely this wonderful
Veil that Flying Soot tells of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Radiance, looking, saw the
creeping shadow rise up and up until
it became a tall woman, young and
beautiful, dressed in long grey robes that
swept in trailing webs from her arms
and shoulders to her feet. Her black hair
fell straight to her knees; her eyes were
very dark, and looked as though they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
never smiled, although even now, the
Prince heard that strange laughter
floating from her lips that had echoed
in his ears as he had pursued the flame
that he had believed to be his Princess.</p>

<p>He turned indignant eyes upon her.
&#8220;Who are you that mock me thus?&#8221; he
demanded, wondering as he spoke
whether this could be the Earth Fairy
in disguise.</p>

<p>The woman did not answer, but
looked at him intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak,&#8221; commanded the Prince.
&#8220;Are you the wicked Earth Fairy, that
you laugh so heartlessly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No Earth Fairy am I,&#8221; replied the
grey woman. &#8220;I am the Shadow Witch,
and with me are all my servants.&#8221; She
waved her arms, and out of the gloom,
as she herself had done, sprang a host of
pale grey figures who stood behind her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
murmuring, &#8220;Yes, we are her servants&mdash;her
servants the Shadows, who come
and go at her behest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you it is, then, who have so
cruelly deceived me, and lured me by
your false flame from following my
Princess,&#8221; cried Prince Radiance to the
Shadow Witch.</p>

<p>&#8220;True enough,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;and
why should I not?&#8221; She tossed her
black hair from her face, and continued.
&#8220;I grow so weary in this Land
of Shadows, with none but my creeping
servants about me, naught but my own
grey magic to fill my hours. Seldom
does a stranger cross through my land;
more seldom have I a chance to look
upon the magic of others. All the tricks
of my brother, the Wizard of the Cave,
I know by heart. I am tired of watching
him play them day after day. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
should I not lure you from your path if
it gives me an hour of pleasure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you are the friend of the
Earth Fairy,&#8221; exclaimed the Prince,
&#8220;and you have led me here to steal my
fairy Veil if you can, but be assured you
will never obtain it in spite of all your
craft.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch, who had bent her
eyes upon the ground, raised them now,
and turned upon the Prince an earnest
gaze as though she rejoiced to look
upon him. &#8220;I am no friend of the Earth
Fairy,&#8221; she answered quietly. &#8220;She is
nothing to me. I will tell you fully if
you wish to know, why it is that I have
brought you here. Of late as I sat unobserved
in a corner of the Wizard&#8217;s
Cave, where my brother dwells, I saw
Flying Soot come in, and heard him say
that he had work for my brother to do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
if he was willing. What could that
mean but mischief? I crept close, yet
taking care lest I should be seen, and
listened keenly that I might lose nothing.
Thus I learned all that Flying
Soot had to tell him concerning yourself
and Princess White Flame, and
about the Veil that the Earth Fairy
claims that you have stolen from her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; interrupted the Prince indignantly.
&#8220;If she says that she tells a
wicked falsehood. The magic Veil is a
gift to me from the Wise One. The
Earth Fairy has never even beheld it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;However that may be,&#8221; answered
the Shadow Witch, shaking out her grey
sleeves, &#8220;she means to wrest it from you,
and my brother has promised to help
her. You may take my word for it that
his help is not to be despised. I heard
Flying Soot suggest also that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
get me to assist in the matter, but the
Wizard replied, &#8216;Nay, you need not
trouble yourself to ask her. She can do
nothing that is really worth while.&#8217;
When he said that, I determined to
cheat them both, and as you see, I have
done so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, that you should have succeeded,&#8221;
cried Prince Radiance. &#8220;It
may be that even now my Princess is in
the hands of your wicked brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is then this Princess so dear to you?&#8221;
asked the Shadow Witch softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes. So dear that no witchcraft
of yours shall be able to keep me from
her,&#8221; exclaimed the Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet she is no more than a flame, and
a voice,&#8221; murmured the Shadow Witch.</p>

<p>&#8220;But such a voice as none have ever
heard before, and such a flame, so pure,
so white, that I wonder how I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
have been deceived by the false flame of
your contriving that has lured me here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lips of the Shadow Witch curled
in a smile. &#8220;I have much skill with
magic,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Beautiful may be
the flame of your Princess, of wondrous
sweetness may be her voice, yet if you
would consent to remain in my land, I
think I should be able to make you forget
them both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; replied Prince Radiance
firmly, &#8220;that would never be.&#8221; Turning
from her, he sought to depart, but
the Shadow Witch would not have it so.
She waved her long arms to her servants,
and instantly they surrounded him
in so dense a barrier that he could not
pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must hear me yet further,&#8221; cried
the Shadow Witch. &#8220;I am not so cruel,
perhaps, as you think. It was not alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
that I desired to cheat my brother and
Flying Soot, for when I saw your face
so full of hope and courage it cheered
me as none had ever done before. Because
of this I would have saved you
from his evil power. Well did I know
that he had promised not to harm the
Princess, but I feared that you might
not escape in safety, and therefore I led
you here. And then&mdash;besides&mdash;I am so
lonely in my kingdom.&#8221; She drew
nearer, and held out her hands beseechingly.
Her pleading voice spoke on.
&#8220;Oh if you would but stay with me. I
long for brightness, for light, for cheer.
These you can give me. Stay, ah stay
with me, Prince Radiance. In my land
you shall be prince and ruler. Stay, and
teach me to forget my witch&#8217;s tricks;
stay, and help me to learn nobler ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Radiance looked into the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of the Shadow Witch, and saw that her
eyes overflowed with tears. Gently he
took her hand, gently he answered her.
&#8220;Though you have drawn me away
from my beloved Princess, I bear you
no malice. Yet I cannot stay with you,
for my heart follows the Princess White
Flame. I have sworn to deliver her, and
to my vow I give my life. You tell me
that you are not cruel. Prove it then.
Lead me back to my Princess quickly;
show me where to find this Cave where
your brother dwells.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch sighed bitterly
and drew her hand away. &#8220;If I let you
go, you will never come again.&#8221; Silent
she stood, wavering in indecision, but
at length she spoke quickly, &#8220;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I
will let you go. I will even do as
you ask, and take you to the Cave myself,
for in this Land of Shadows you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
would wander long, and never find your
way.&#8221; Turning to her band of servants,
she waved them back. &#8220;Go,&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Go, till I summon you
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a flutter of grey garments they
dissolved like mist at her command.
Then the Shadow Witch stretched her
hand to Prince Radiance. &#8220;Come,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Follow where I lead you,
and you shall learn that I spoke truly
when I said that in this land there is one
at least who is not altogether unkind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gratefully the Prince obeyed her, and
before he could have believed it possible,
they stood together at the spot
where he had begun to pursue the false
flame. A high black cliff rose before
them. The Shadow Witch pointed to it
and said, &#8220;My brother&#8217;s Cave lies yonder.
Enter that wide opening in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
cliff-side. Pursue the narrow way that
leads from it, and erelong you will reach
the Cave Hall where he sits. Gladly
would I give you some weapon to use
against him, but there is only one that
he fears, and alas, I do not possess it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What weapon may that be?&#8221; inquired
the Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the Sword of Flames,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;He has never seen it, but its
fame has reached him, and he knows
well that before it his power would be
shattered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Radiance smiled, and laid his
hand upon his scabbard. &#8220;Then am I
well assured of victory,&#8221; he told her,
&#8220;for the Sword of Flames is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Sword of Flames? You have
the Sword of Flames?&#8221; exclaimed she.
&#8220;Ah, now you may meet him safely.
And yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she warned him, &#8220;he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
clever, very clever. Beware lest he steal
your strength from you and overpower
you before you are aware.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be watchful,&#8221; he promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell then,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;and
forget not the Shadow Witch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always will I remember you and be
grateful,&#8221; replied the Prince. With a
wave of his hand he left her. Rapidly
he mounted the cliff, and found himself
at the entrance to the Wizard&#8217;s Cave.</p>

<p>The Shadow Witch, who had remained
below, watched him sadly until
she saw him disappear in the Cave&#8217;s
mouth. Then she turned away to go
back to the Land of Shadows. But suddenly
she changed her mind. Silently
she, too, climbed the cliff wall, trailing
her long grey robes behind her, and
entered the Cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother is so clever,&#8221; she muttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to herself, &#8220;and none know his
tricks so well as I. He shall not harm
this Prince, no&mdash;nor the Princess that
he loves. I will go to make sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHILE Prince Radiance, deceived
by the Shadow Witch had gone
away into the Land of Shadows, the
Earth Fairy on her part had proceeded
straight to the Cave of Darkness where
the Wizard dwelt.</p>

<p>A figure that she believed to be the
Prince followed the Princess steadily,
so that she suspected nothing wrong.</p>

<p>The Cave was black and forbidding;
its walls of charcoal were full of gaping
crevices; and a very little way from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
entrance it became pitch dark. Because
of this great darkness it was the
duty of many Imps, the servants of the
Wizard, to run back and forth with
glimmering lanterns, to light the way of
those who came to see their master.</p>

<p>Flying Soot, who had arrived some
time before, had told his story to the
Wizard and had easily gained his consent
to assist the Earth Fairy. So when
the Earth Fairy with her companions
reached the entrance to the Cave she
found the Imps waiting there to conduct
her to the Wizard. The Princess
was first to enter, and so brilliant was
the light of her pure flame that the
lanterns of the Imps were quite dimmed
by it. The Imps themselves stared at her
in the utmost astonishment. Never before
had they seen a light so gloriously
beautiful. Scurrying in front to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the way, they turned back every few
moments to behold her. Behind the
Princess came the supposed prince, and
after him came the Earth Fairy, holding
her cloak closely about her as she went,
lest she should become blackened by the
walls of the Cave.</p>

<p>Far down in a wider portion of the
Cave called the Cave Hall, sat the Wizard
in a great black armchair pushed
close against the wall. He was very
ancient and grim. His long dingy
white hair and beard fell down over a
loose black robe and mantle thickly
powdered with finest charcoal. At his
least movement little clouds of black
dust flew from his garments and floated
round about the Cave. His jet black eyes
sparkled so sharply in his head that one
saw immediately that he was not a person
with whom one could trifle. Flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Soot, perched at a respectful distance on
a lump of charcoal, waited for the coming
of the Earth Fairy. He was quite
sure that this time he had obtained for
her the help of one who could not fail.
He kept his eyes fixed on the dark passage
before them, and at last he cried
softly, &#8220;They come, Sir Wizard, they
come, for I behold the flame of the
Princess!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the Wizard beckoned to one
of the many Imps who clustered about.
&#8220;Bring hither the Urn of Vapors,&#8221; commanded
he, &#8220;and make no delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away rushed the Imp accompanied
by a dozen or more of his companions
to do the Wizard&#8217;s bidding, and presently
a low rumbling was heard. It was
the Imps returning, all pushing and
shoving a huge black urn. A ponderous
cover sealed it tightly, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Imps had succeeded in placing it beside
their master, Flying Soot saw that it was
so tall that it reached almost to the
Wizard&#8217;s shoulders. Its sides were covered
with inscriptions of evil magic.
The Wizard scrutinized it closely, and
satisfied himself that it was the one that
he desired. Then he waved back his
servants and turned to Flying Soot.
&#8220;When I lift this cover,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the
Earth Fairy has but to rush forward and
take what she desires, for in the instant
that the Prince is met by my magic
vapor he will fall to the Earth unable to
offer her the slightest resistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flying Soot had no time to answer,
for at that moment Princess White
Flame, driven by the Earth Fairy, fluttered
terror-stricken into the Cave Hall,
and came to rest in a corner at some distance
from the Wizard. Soon after he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
whom the Earth Fairy believed to be
Prince Radiance appeared also, but before
he could advance into the Cave
Hall the Wizard stretched forth his
hand quickly to the urn. Uttering
mystic words he lifted the cover and
forthwith a stream of vapor rushed from
it directly toward the Prince.</p>

<p>It had no sooner reached him than
the Wizard&#8217;s prophecy was fulfilled; he
fell to the ground in a heap, apparently
without life.</p>

<p>The Princess seeing this uttered a
piercing cry, but held by the spell of
her enchantress she could not stir from
her place.</p>

<p>The Wizard replaced the lid of the
urn, and the Earth Fairy rushed forward
to pounce upon the helpless
Prince. Her eyes glittered with joy to
see him in her power at last.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>She tore back his cloak, sure that the
Veil of Disenchantment was hidden beneath
it, but as soon as her fingers
touched the prostrate form it vanished.
Where it had been, she saw only the
charcoal floor of the Cave. Puzzled
and astonished she struggled to her feet,
and stood dazed, peering down at the
spot where the figure had lain as though
she could scarcely believe her senses.
When at last she could no longer doubt
that the Prince had indeed disappeared,
she rushed to the Wizard, shrieking in
fury, &#8220;What evil magic is this that you
have wrought upon me, wicked one
that you are? You have ruined everything
by your miserable enchantments.
You have destroyed the Veil as well as
the Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Wizard interrupted her angrily.
&#8220;How dare you speak to me in this manner,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
he thundered, bringing his fist
down upon the top of the urn. &#8220;You,
who have deceived me by pretending to
bring a Prince before me? But I will
show you that you cannot trifle with the
Wizard of the Cave.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved to his Imps. They understood
him without a word, and bounded
forward with ropes of darkness in their
hands to bind the Earth Fairy. It would
have gone hard with her then if it had
not been for Flying Soot. He jumped
down with all speed from his lump of
charcoal, and ran to cast himself at the
Wizard&#8217;s feet. He threw his arms about
them, and tried to soothe him. &#8220;Sir
Wizard, Sir Wizard,&#8221; he pleaded,
&#8220;listen but a moment. There has certainly
been some strange mistake. I assure
you that we are not to blame. This
creature that has so suddenly vanished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
could never have been the Prince.
Someone&mdash;I know not who, has tricked
us all. I pray you, do nothing rash to
the Earth Fairy. She is not to blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Imps who surrounded the Earth
Fairy, hearing this, stood swinging the
ropes of darkness in their hands, waiting
to see what their master would say,
before they ventured to bind her fast.
White Flame, weeping and trembling
in her corner, checked her sobs and
listened breathlessly for the Wizard&#8217;s
reply.</p>

<p>The Wizard thought for a time in
silence. Then at last he spoke. &#8220;Since
you yourselves have played no tricks
upon me, there is but one way in which
to explain this matter. My sister, the
Shadow Witch, has been at work. She
it is who has caused us to see a prince
where no prince was. The real prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
she has without doubt lured away into
the Land of Shadows.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words Flying Soot rose to
his feet and turned to the Earth Fairy.
&#8220;Then we must go to seek him there,&#8221;
he declared.</p>

<p>The Earth Fairy was but too anxious
to set forth. At a signal from their
master, the Imps drew back, leaving her
free to go as she would, but as she was
about to depart from the Wizard&#8217;s presence
with her companions, an Imp came
rushing down the long dark corridor
from the Cave entrance, and into the
Cave Hall. &#8220;Sir Wizard&mdash;Sir Wizard!&#8221;
he panted. &#8220;A second prince approaches!
Even now he is within the
entrance to the Cave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Certain that this could be no other
than Prince Radiance himself, the Earth
Fairy and Flying Soot paused instantly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>The Wizard, seeing this, was not unwilling
to prove his skill upon the true
prince. He spoke in a friendly manner
to the Earth Fairy, and prepared himself
once more to lift the cover of his
Urn of Vapors. The Imps, flinging
their ropes of darkness into a corner, retreated
so close against the Cave Wall
that they could scarcely be seen. In her
corner quivered Princess White Flame,
her longing to see her beloved Radiance
once more overborne by her fear of
what might befall him at the hands of
his foes.</p>

<p>Each in his own place peered eagerly
down the dusky corridor, awaiting in
silence the coming of the Prince.</p>

<p>But one accompanied the Prince
whom they did not expect. It was the
Shadow Witch. Although by her grey
magic she had sent a shadow prince to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
deceive her brother, she had never for
a moment lost sight of Prince Radiance,
and now that he was drawing near to
the Wizard, she knew that the time for
her further good offices had arrived. If
she could prevent him from being seen
by her brother until the Prince was near
enough to use his Sword of Flames, she
knew that all would be well.</p>

<p>Prince Radiance was so near to the
Cave Hall that one short turn would
bring him into the Wizard&#8217;s view. The
Shadow Witch knew that her time to
help him had come. She waved her
long arms and instantly a thick curtain
of shadow fell directly in front of the
Prince. He could not see a yard before
him, and stood still at once, fearing that
some trap had been laid for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be afraid,&#8221; whispered a voice
at his ear. &#8220;Go forward. It is I, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Shadow Witch, who have come to help
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Radiance knew her voice, yet
he hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear nothing,&#8221; insisted the Shadow
Witch. &#8220;Go forward, and no harm
shall come to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trusting her then, the Prince trod
boldly on, and before him went the curtain
of the Shadow Witch like a covering
shield. Beyond it the Wizard and
his companions watched and waited,
but saw only the corridor of the Cave
stretching before them darker than ever,
and filled with shadows so deep that
their eyes could not penetrate them.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the Prince,
and presently the voice of the Shadow
Witch was heard again at his ear.
&#8220;Have out your Sword of Flames,&#8221; she
whispered. &#8220;The time has come.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>Radiance laid his hand upon the hilt.
At that moment the shadow curtain dissolved,
and he beheld the Wizard little
more than a yard away. So suddenly
had the Prince appeared that the Wizard
started with astonishment, but he recovered
himself immediately, and shot
forth his hand to lift the cover of his urn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now,&#8221; urged the Shadow
Witch, at the Prince&#8217;s ear. &#8220;Now, or it
will be too late!&#8221;</p>

<p>Out flashed the Sword of Flames. It
filled the Cave with blinding light. The
cover of the urn settled back to its place
with a harsh clang, as the Wizard
leaped to his feet, shielding his eyes with
his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Sword of Flames! The Sword
of Flames!&#8221; he shrieked. &#8220;Away!
Away!&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to flee, but fell prostrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
across the Urn of Vapors instead. From
every corner of the Cave sprang a crowd
of Imps in answer to their master&#8217;s cry.
Seeing the dread weapon that flashed in
the hand of Prince Radiance they turned
their backs upon it in terror, and screaming
wildly surrounded the urn in a huddled
mass. Throwing themselves upon
it, they hurried it away into a dim passage,
with their master still lying senseless
across its top. As they disappeared
into the pitch dark opening, a heavy
door of charcoal fell shut behind them,
closing the entrance to the place to
which they fled.</p>

<p>Overjoyed at his victory, Radiance
lifted his eyes to where but a moment
since he had seen Princess White Flame
trembling against the Cave wall, but the
Princess, the Earth Fairy, and Flying
Soot were nowhere to be seen. Except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
for the Shadow Witch he was entirely
alone in the Cave of Darkness.</p>

<p>With a gesture of despair the Prince
let the Sword of Flames drop back into
its sheath. &#8220;What has it availed me to
overcome this miserable Wizard,&#8221; he
groaned, &#8220;since it has brought me no
nearer to my dear White Flame? Again
she has vanished, and I know not where
to seek her; whether in some dusky portion
of this hateful Cave, or in the open
country without.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice of the Shadow Witch answered
him. &#8220;Have courage, good
Prince. All is not lost. Leave the Cave
of Darkness with me, and seek her in
the light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Radiance hesitated, but the
Shadow Witch insisted. &#8220;She is not
here,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;Trust yourself
fully to my guidance, and I will lead you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
safely out.&#8221; Then the Prince yielded,
and together they left the Wizard&#8217;s Hall.
Down the dark corridor they passed
swiftly and soon arrived at the Cave&#8217;s
mouth. There they parted, the Shadow
Witch stealing away with drooped head
to her Land of Shadows, the Prince
standing for a moment gazing with
eager eyes across the plain, hoping that
not far away he might behold the flame
of his Princess.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NO sooner had the Earth Fairy beheld
the sudden downfall of the
Wizard than she immediately fled from
the Cave of Darkness taking Princess
White Flame with her.</p>

<p>Flying Soot, much crestfallen over
the way in which matters had turned
out, kept a little way behind them, for
he was not anxious to speak with the
Earth Fairy until her anger had had
time to cool. When they were well outside
the Cave, however, he drew nearer,
and began as usual to make excuses and
suggest new plans.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>The Earth Fairy listened to him most
ungraciously. &#8220;Speak no more of these
friends of yours,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;for I
have lost all faith in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you will,&#8221; said Flying Soot, with
a shrug of his black shoulders, &#8220;but you
make a grave mistake if you do not try
the Wind in the Chimney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no reason to believe that he
will do any better than those others of
whom you boasted so loudly,&#8221; retorted
the Earth Fairy.</p>

<p>But Flying Soot was not to be discouraged.
He continued to sing the
Wind&#8217;s praises, until finally the Earth
Fairy consented to give him a trial.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have but to wait here in concealment
near the mouth of the Cave
until the Prince comes forth,&#8221; directed
Flying Soot, before he took his leave of
her. &#8220;Then cause the Princess to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
him to the Chimney yonder, and you
will soon see that the Wind is one whose
magic is not to be despised.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gathered his black mantle about
him and departed, and the Earth Fairy
hid herself and Princess White Flame
in a deep cleft close by, from whence
she should be able to see Prince Radiance
the moment that he issued from the
Cave.</p>

<p>With her keen eyes fixed steadily in
that direction the Earth Fairy did not
let her gaze wander elsewhere, and
hence she did not see a tall form creeping
stealthily from dark cliff to dark cliff
as though seeking someone; she did not
see a small grey figure following closely
at his heels. They were Curling Smoke
and the Ash Goblin in quest of the
Prince and Flying Soot.</p>

<p>At last the Earth Fairy&#8217;s watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
was rewarded. She saw Prince Radiance
come from the Cave&#8217;s mouth in
company with the Shadow Witch, saw
him bid her farewell, and saw the
Shadow Witch steal away from him to
her own land.</p>

<p>Then quickly the Earth Fairy came
forth and drove the Princess to where
Prince Radiance could not fail to behold
her when he should set out in quest
of her.</p>

<p>It happened as the Earth Fairy expected;
the Prince searching the plain
with his eyes instantly descried the
Princess. He had not even had time to
call to her, when suddenly the huge grey
form of Curling Smoke wound upon
him from behind, gathered the Prince,
the Princess and the Earth Fairy, one
and all, into a dense cloud of smoke, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
which none could see the other, and
hurried them away toward the Chimney.</p>

<p>The Ash Goblin beholding, danced
for joy, for he had seen Flying Soot vanish
into the Chimney not long since,
and believed that now his time of punishment
was come.</p>

<p>Flying Soot had indeed reached the
great Chimney where the Wind dwelt,
and was even now awaiting the coming
of the Earth Fairy and those that she
should bring with her. The Chimney
was wide and dark, with great rough
boundaries, and the Wind&#8217;s voice was
so strong and boisterous that it could be
heard from the Chimney Mouth to the
Chimney Top. Over the entire Chimney
the Wind ruled, and none dared to
intrude upon him there without first
asking his permission.</p>

<p>It was true that Curling Smoke had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the right of way to the Chimney Top,
but it was well understood that the Wind
was at liberty to deny him entrance to
the Chimney at any time that he chose.</p>

<p>When Flying Soot had arrived at the
Chimney Mouth, the Wind had howled
a welcome to him, and bade him enter.
This Flying Soot had made haste to do,
and finding a seat beside the Wind had
told his errand without loss of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; whistled the Wind, &#8220;what you
say interests me greatly, and I am perfectly
willing to do as you ask and help
the Earth Fairy. You may give yourself
no anxiety about the Veil. I care
nothing whatever for it. Of one thing
you must assure me, however, and that
is that she has had no dealings with
Curling Smoke in this matter, for I am
on bad terms with him at present, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
refuse to take part in anything in which
he has at any time been concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flying Soot rolled up his eyes and
swore to the Wind in the Chimney that
neither he nor the Earth Fairy had had
anything to do with Curling Smoke, nor
would they think of approaching him.
So the Wind was satisfied and declared
that he would exert all his powers in the
Earth Fairy&#8217;s behalf.</p>

<p>The Soot Fairy was just about to
thank him for the promise of his good
offices, when suddenly the Wind leaned
from his seat, and peered down toward
the Chimney Mouth. Flying Soot
looked also. Up the Chimney rose a
dense cloud of smoke, and in it, so enveloped
by it that they could not see
each other, though they were plainly
visible to the eyes of the Wind and Flying
Soot, were the Earth Fairy, Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
White Flame, and Prince Radiance.
Behind them loomed an immense grey
shape. It was Curling Smoke on his
way to the Chimney Top, driving his
enemies before him.</p>

<p>The Wind started from his seat in a
towering rage. &#8220;So this is the way you
and your Earth Fairy have deceived
me,&#8221; he howled, turning upon Flying
Soot. &#8220;This is the way in which she
has had nothing to do with Curling
Smoke. But you, her messenger, shall
learn what happens when you trifle with
the Wind. Up, out of my Chimney, to
the punishment that you well deserve.&#8221;</p>

<p>With one blast he drove the Soot
Fairy up and away through the great
black spaces of the Chimney, and hurled
him out into the Great World Beyond.
Well did the Wind know that from
thence he could not return.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>Then with so mighty a rush that nothing
could stand before it he pounced
upon Curling Smoke and those whom
he had in his power. &#8220;How dare you
come into my presence unbidden?&#8221; he
shrieked. &#8220;Out of my kingdom all of
you! Out, out into the Borderland.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away they were driven by the fury of
the Wind like leaves before a storm,
down through the black Chimney and
out of its mouth, into the Borderland
near to the Kingdom of Earth.</p>

<p>There the Wind scattered Curling
Smoke far and wide in thin pale streamers
that slowly floated back at last to the
great plain from whence he had come.</p>

<p>As for the wicked Earth Fairy, the
Wind in the Chimney drove her away
and away into the Land of Desolate
Places there to remain forever a
prisoner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>In the Borderland he cast down
Prince Radiance, and roughly tossed
the flame of the Princess upon a pile of
scattered ash, and blackened coals.</p>

<p>Then with his anger satisfied, the
Wind rushed back to his Chimney,
shrieking and howling with glee at the
punishment that he had dealt out to
those who had offended him.</p>

<p>Princess White Flame, so pale that
she could scarcely be discerned, quivered
and flickered where the Wind had
rudely thrown her. Too weak to cry
out, she only sighed faintly, and sank
still lower upon the ashes.</p>

<p>She knew not that by her entrance
into the Borderland the cruel spell had
been broken by which the Earth Fairy
had so long compelled her to flee from
Prince Radiance. She only knew that
she felt helpless, and almost without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
life. And indeed the Princess was now
in great danger, for away from the Fire,
no Fire Fairy can live for long.</p>

<p>Over Prince Radiance the Borderland
possessed no evil power. He arose
unharmed from the stones and looked
anxiously about him for his Princess.
So almost extinguished was her fairy
flame that at first he did not see her, and
his heart was rent by fear lest the Wind
had carried her away from him forever.</p>

<p>But presently he descried her lying
there, as if unable to proceed further,
and hope rose again in his breast. In
haste he took forth the Veil of Disenchantment&mdash;in
haste he ran to her holding
it securely in his hand. He reached
her, he bent above her, and she did not
stir.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last my White Flame,&#8221; he cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
in an outburst of joy, &#8220;at last you flee
from me no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>He cast the mystic Veil over the flame
of the Princess. Like a web of gossamer
it settled slowly upon her, and the
Prince, scarce daring to breathe as he
watched it, saw the Wise One&#8217;s promise
instantly fulfilled.</p>

<p>At his feet, visible in her true form,
lay a creature so beautiful, so charming
as none had ever seen the like before.
The Veil of Disenchantment, in touching
her, had changed to a marvelous
robe, soft and silvery, that swept in shining
folds from her head to her feet. Over
her shoulders and down to her knees
streamed the silken splendor of her hair;
pale gold it was, and finer than the finest
floss. Her delicate red lips were closed,
her eyes fast shut.</p>

<p>Prince Radiance fell on his knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
before her and touched her gently.
&#8220;White Flame,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;dear
White Flame, awake and speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess lay there pale and still,
giving no sign that she had heard. The
Prince laid his hand on hers, but felt no
glow of life.</p>

<p>In wild alarm he cried aloud, &#8220;White
Flame! White Flame! Awake&mdash;awake!&#8221;</p>

<p>Still the Princess made no answer,
and though he tried by every means he
knew to revive her, his efforts were all
in vain.</p>

<p>At length, choked with grief he
bowed his head upon her breast. If he
had reached her, and freed her, only to
lose her thus, he had no wish left except
to die by her side.</p>

<p>A fierce tug at his arm aroused him.
&#8220;Do you not know that a Fire Fairy
cannot exist in the Borderland?&#8221; demanded
an indignant voice. &#8220;Take her
back to the Fire at once, and warm her
back to life.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>The Prince raised his head, and saw
at his elbow a fuzzy little creature, who
clutched and shook him with a pudgy
hand. It was an Elf of the Borderland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; cried the Elf, &#8220;bestir
yourself, or it will be too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly the Prince bent over Princess
White Flame to raise her in his
arms, but before he could do so the Elf
had laid a fuzzy ear to the heart of the
unconscious Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, me,&#8221; he murmured, lifting his
head, and regarding the Prince mournfully,
&#8220;I fear she can never live to reach
there. She should have warmth at this
very moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly had the Elf spoken, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Prince Radiance remembered his good
Grey Pouch. He tore it open, took out
a glowing coal quickly, and laid it over
the heart of the Princess. What was his
joy to see an exquisite roseate glow steal
into her face, to feel her hand grow
warm under its fairy touch. Then as
it lay there warm against her heart, the
eyes of the Princess opened slowly to
behold Prince Radiance bending above
her; her ears awoke to his voice calling
tenderly, &#8220;White Flame, my own White
Flame!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment she gazed up at him
lovingly, too overcome with joy to
speak; then fear crept into her face, and
she clung to him whispering, &#8220;The
Earth Fairy!&mdash;where is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone, gone forever,&#8221; the Prince assured
her, drawing her closer to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
breast. &#8220;Her wicked spells are broken.
Fear her no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess, beholding her hands,
her figure, her shining garments, knew
that it was indeed true, and gave a low
cry of rapture.</p>

<p>Prince Radiance raised her gently
to her feet. &#8220;Come,&#8221; said he, &#8220;let me
lead you home to your father, King Red
Flame, as I have promised. He waits
and yearns for you in his Palace of
Burning Coals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, let us go to him quickly, dear
Radiance,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Had it not
been for you he must have waited
always in vain.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they set out, and the Elf of the
Borderland went before them, and
guided them to the boundary of the
Land of Fire, by the nearest way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">FAR away in the Land of the Fire
Fairies, King Red Flame mourned
daily the loss of his dear daughter. As
day followed day and no news of her
reached him he became more and more
fearful that he should never again look
upon her exquisite flame, or hear her
voice speaking to him in tenderness and
love.</p>

<p>The old nurse, Grey Smoke, did all
that she could to hearten him, and as for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
herself, she never lost the hope and
belief that at no distant day her beloved
mistress would come safely home.</p>

<p>The Fire Fairies spoke of her always
in hushed voices, and when they repeated
her story to one another as they
worked or played, they would sigh, and
whisper, &#8220;Ah, she was beautiful, our
Princess White Flame&mdash;beautiful and
good as none else.&#8221; But they spoke of
her always as one who would never
come again.</p>

<p>At last one day King Red Flame
could bear his anxious thoughts no
longer. He left the Palace of Burning
Coals, and took his way to the hut
of the Wise One. There he hoped to
find encouragement and counsel. Arrived
at the low red door he knocked,
and presently he heard the Wise One&#8217;s
voice bidding him enter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>The King did so, and talked to him
long and despondently, but the Wise
One enjoined upon him not to give up
hope. &#8220;There will be difficulties to be
met and conquered,&#8221; he told him, &#8220;and
that takes time. But something assures
me that the Princess is alive and well.
As for Prince Radiance, you may trust
him entirely. Take courage; at any time
they may return in triumph.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the Wise One spoke thus to
the King, Grey Smoke stood in the high
tower of the Palace of Burning Coals
and gazed earnestly out across the country,
as she did many times each day, in
order that she might be the first to catch
a glimpse of the Princess when she
should return.</p>

<p>Grey Smoke was old, but her eyes
were still keen. On this day, as she
looked, she saw in the distance two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
travelers approaching hand in hand.
One of these travelers appeared to her to
be Prince Radiance. She waited a few
moments to make sure of it; but soon
she could no longer doubt. It was he in
very truth. The other, her eyes told her
for a certainty, was her beloved young
mistress. The heart of old Grey Smoke
leaped for joy. As rapidly as her age
would permit she descended the steps of
the tower, calling out with trembling
voice, &#8220;The Princess comes! The Princess
White Flame comes!&#8221;</p>

<p>The palace fairies at their tasks heard
it. Knowing that Grey Smoke was one
who made no mistakes, they seized upon
the glad news, and rushed from one end
of the palace to the other shouting it:
&#8220;The Princess comes! The Princess
comes!&#8221;</p>

<p>The garden fairies were not slow to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
hear it, and they too took up the excited
cry, &#8220;The Princess White Flame comes!
The Princess White Flame comes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grey Smoke, anxious to be the first
to bring the glad tidings to her master,
went in search of him, and after her the
fairies one and all came trooping, trooping
from everywhere. In this manner
they drew near to the little red hut in the
shrubbery. King Red Flame heard the
tumult and caught the words of their
cry. He hurried forth, followed by the
Wise One. &#8220;Where is the Princess
White Flame?&#8221; exclaimed the King,
&#8220;Tell me quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no need of any answer, for
in that instant he saw her coming down
the shining way&mdash;his dear lost daughter&mdash;lovelier
by far than he had ever
dreamed she might be. He heard the
music of her voice calling to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
sweeter even than he had so fondly remembered
it.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with her came Prince
Radiance leading her safely to her journey&#8217;s
end.</p>

<p>King Red Flame opened his arms to
her crying in ecstasy, &#8220;Ah that I should
at last behold you, my White Flame, my
own dear child!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Princess White Flame ran to
him, and nestled at his breast, weeping
and laughing all in a breath for pure
happiness.</p>

<p>For a little he held her thus in silence;
but presently, thirsting to hear of all that
had transpired during her long absence
from him, he begged the Prince to relate
the story of their wanderings.</p>

<p>Briefly the tale was told, and as the
King listened intently, the eager fairies
clustered close about him meanwhile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
that they also might lose no syllable concerning
the perils that had been safely
passed. The Wise One, hearing,
stroked his beard with satisfaction that
all had turned out so triumphantly and
well.</p>

<p>When the last words had been
spoken, King Red Flame led his beloved
child to Prince Radiance, and
placed her hand in his. &#8220;Noble Prince,&#8221;
he exclaimed, with deep emotion, &#8220;take
my daughter, with her father&#8217;s love and
gratitude, for valiantly have you won
your bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then King Red Flame turned to the
thronging fairies, and raising his voice
so as to be heard by all, he cried,
&#8220;Hasten, one and all, to the Palace of
Burning Coals. Prepare all things for
the wedding. Let swift messengers
speed to the Kingdom of Light, to bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
its ruler to the marriage of his son. And
you, my good Grey Smoke, who know
so well how to carry out my desires, see
to it that never fairy wedding in the
Land of Fire has equaled this of my beloved
daughter Princess White Flame,
and my dear son Prince Radiance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus, amid tumults of rejoicing, did
Princess White Flame and Prince Radiance
enter upon their life of never-ending
happiness.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
